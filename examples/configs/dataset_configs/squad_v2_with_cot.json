            "question": "When is King Mom symbolically burnt?",
            "answer": "On the evening before Lent",
            "context": "Carnival means weeks of events that bring colourfully decorated floats, contagiously throbbing music, luxuriously costumed groups of celebrants of all ages, King and Queen elections, electrifying jump-ups and torchlight parades, the Jouvert morning: the Children's Parades and finally the Grand Parade. Aruba's biggest celebration is a month-long affair consisting of festive 'jump-ups' (street parades), spectacular parades and creative contests. Music and flamboyant costumes play a central role, from the Queen elections to the Grand Parade. Street parades continue in various districts throughout the month, with brass band, steel drum and roadmarch tunes. On the evening before Lent, Carnival ends with the symbolic burning of King Momo.",
            "explanation": "The given context states that Carnival is a month-long celebration, and it mentions that Carnival ends with the symbolic burning of King Momo. It specifies that this burning takes place 'on the evening before Lent.' Lent is a Christian period of fasting and reflection that begins on Ash Wednesday. Therefore, the answer is: King Momo is symbolically burnt on the evening before Lent."

            "question": "How far does the Alps range stretch?",
            "answer": "the Mediterranean Sea north above the Po basin, extending through France from Grenoble, eastward through mid and southern Switzerland",
            "context": "The Alps are a crescent shaped geographic feature of central Europe that ranges in a 800 km (500 mi) arc from east to west and is 200 km (120 mi) in width. The mean height of the mountain peaks is 2.5 km (1.6 mi). The range stretches from the Mediterranean Sea north above the Po basin, extending through France from Grenoble, eastward through mid and southern Switzerland. The range continues toward Vienna in Austria, and east to the Adriatic Sea and into Slovenia. To the south it dips into northern Italy and to the north extends to the south border of Bavaria in Germany. In areas like Chiasso, Switzerland, and Neuschwanstein, Bavaria, the demarcation between the mountain range and the flatlands are clear; in other places such as Geneva, the demarcation is less clear. The countries with the greatest alpine territory are Switzerland, France, Austria and Italy.",
            "explanation": "The given context describes the geographic features and extent of the Alps. It states that the range stretches from the Mediterranean Sea, extends north above the Po basin, and goes through France from Grenoble. It also mentions that it extends eastward through mid and southern Switzerland. Therefore, based on the provided information, the range of the Alps stretches from the Mediterranean Sea in the south to the Po basin, through France from Grenoble, and eastward through mid and southern Switzerland."
