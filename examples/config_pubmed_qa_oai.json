            "context": "The seafaring industry remains a hazardous occupation that requires sophisticated systems of risk and fitness assessment. This study aims to investigate the extent of agreement between Approved Doctors (ADs) and Medical Referees (MRs) when they assess a seafarer's fitness.\nBetween 2003 and 2009 a total of 232,878 seafarer medical examinations were carried out by ADs, of which 465 were considered by the MRs because the seafarer appealed against the AD's decision. The extent of agreement between ADs and MRs was studied.\nTwo hundred and sixty-eight (58%) cases seen by the ADs were classed as category 4 'permanently unfit'; the referees only placed 85 (18%) of them in this category. On the other hand, 252 (54%) cases seen by the MRs were classed as category 2 'fit with restrictions', while the ADs had only placed 111 (24%) in this category. The overall agreement between the assessors (AD vs. MR) was poor (Kappa K = 0.18).\nFor cardiovascular diseases and for mental ill-health, access to additional information by the MR was the commonest reason for changing the fitness category, but for all other conditions factors such as the experience and knowledge of the MRs or their different interpretation of the standards were the most frequent reasons for a change to fitness category or to restrictions."

            "context": "In an attempt to improve the care they provide for their patients with breast cancer, the authors' institution developed a multidisciplinary breast cancer clinic (MDBCC) to offer 'one-stop shopping' consultation and support for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients.\nOne hundred sixty-two patients, the control group for this study, were evaluated at Henry Ford Hospital during the year prior to the opening of the MDBCC. These patients, who were referred in the traditional sequential consultation manner, were compared with the first 177 patients seen during the first year of the clinic's operation. Retrospective chart reviews were conducted to assess treatment timeliness, and anonymous questionnaires were used to assess patient satisfaction.\nThe authors found that the MDBCC increased patient satisfaction by encouraging involvement of patients' families and friends and by helping patients make treatment decisions (P<0.001). The time between diagnosis and the initiation of treatment was also significantly decreased (42.2 days vs. 29.6 days; P<0.0008)."

            "answer": "no",
            "context": "Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels can show wide fluctuations when repeatedly measured. Here we investigatewd if: (a) biopsy timing influences the prostate cancer (PC) detection rate in patients with fluctuating PSA (flu-PSA) in comparison with patients with steadily increasing PSA (si-PSA); (b) PSA slope estimated in patients with flu-PSA predicts a different risk of cancer detection; (c) flu-PSA and si-PSA patients develop PC in topographically different sites; (d) the behaviour of pre-operative PSA is an expression of a disease with defferent characteristics to the following radical prostatectomy.\nThe study involved 211 patients who underwent at least a second biopsy after a first negative prostate biopsy. PSA Slope, PSA velocity (PSAV) and PSA doubling time (PSADT) were estimated. Flu-PSA level was defined as a PSA series with at least one PSA value lower than the one immediately preceding it.\n82 patients had flu-PSA levels and 129 si-PSA levels. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of cancer detection, clinical or pathological stage, but the si-PSA group with cancer had a higher Gleason score. No difference was found for PSA Slope between flu-PSA patients with cancer and those without."
