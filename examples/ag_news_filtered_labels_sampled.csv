Variables hold a handle to the object rather than the object itself. This brings PHP more in line with other OO languages (like Java) and removes some of the ugly from PHP OO code, but it also means that objects are treated differently from all the other types.

A deficit is a form of tax. A rising deficit is a rising tax. At some point, unless he's planning on going bankrupt, we're going to have to pay back all the money we're pouring into Iraq. And unlike spending on education, health care, or infrastructure, there's no resulting growth to fund the payback. The money for Iraq is coming out of our pockets, one way or the other, sooner or later. I have a feeling it's not going to come in the form of higher taxes for his patrons. And when they say deficits will be paid for by our children and grandchildren, that's wishful thinking. Many economists believe the bill will come due while you and I are alive.</p>\<p>I remain skeptical of Kerry. Given the huge problems caused by Bush, wouldn't it be something if he had proposals that had a chance of making sure those problems don't plague a Kerry Administration. Some form of extra accountability if he should break a major commitment, as Bush did about going to war in Iraq. (I agree with Kerry, I remember the spin at the time the Senate voted to authorize the war, the President was clear that this was just an option, not a plan.) How can we make sure we're not just replacing one bad actor with another? Really, Kerry hasn't offered us anything substantial here.</p>\<p><img src=""http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2004/10/27/miller.jpg"" width=""57"" height=""68"" border=""0"" align=""right"" hspace=""15"" vspace=""5"" alt=""A picture named miller.jpg"">The comedian Dennis Miller, who has turned into a Republican (amazing) was on some talk show yesterday and said something pretty reasonable. If Kerry is elected, he's going to get behind Kerry, because he'll be the President. Since I'm voting for Kerry, I can balance his promise, by saying if Kerry is elected, I plan to get on his case and stay on it all through his term. We've had enough horrible government. We must be suspicious of these guys, no matter what party they're from. Now, to be perfectly straight, I don't think I could support a re-elected George Bush. I stood behind him after we were attacked, this is the American thing to do, it's one of the reasons our country is so great. But enough already. We're so divided because of Bush that people are actually talking openly about <i>civil war</i> after the election. This is no good. I find myself ready to say to our friends in Europe and Asia, it's time for you guys to plan your invasion of the US. We need a lot of help here. One more time, we can solve this problem ourselves, but so far we've missed every opportunity to do so.</p>\",Software

"\<p>On the news, they're saying Bill Clinton will be fully recovered in two-three months. Not true. My doctors told me that full recovery would actually never come, that you never get as good as new, but that's okay, because the bypass surgery saved my life. </p>\<p>The rule my doctors told me, which proved to be right in my case, is that after one month you're halfway back, then after two months, three-quarters, and so on. A year after the surgery you're functioning pretty well, in fact probably <i>better</i> than you were before the surgery, because your heart wasn't working very well beforehand. </p>\<p>Another thing that seems to be true for all bypass survivors is that they put off seeing the heart doctor long after they know they have a problem. I explained this to a friend this way. Up to that point in your life you had worked through every physical problem through exercise, diet and rest, and it worked; esp muscle ills (the heart is a muscle). But this is the first time for many people (it was for me, and probably for Clinton too) that you couldn't exercise your way back to health. I think a lot of people die because of ths mistake. If you feel chest pain, go to the doctor, asap. It used to be a death sentence, a couple of generations ago, but now, it's a pretty normal procedure to fix the clogged coronary arteries. </p>\<p>That Clinton was striken with this, of course is not good news for him, but it is good news for everyone else (and maybe it will be good for him too). I didn't know that Henry Kissinger had bypass 20 years ago, as did Dick Cheney. They're still walking around. Now what my cardiologist said makes more sense. He said I should think of my lifespan in decades, not years. I didn't really believe it, but now I do. Knock wood, praise Murphy, I am not a lawyer, etc.</p>\<p>Anyway, getting a good look at your mortality, up close and personal, can make for great transformations. I was able to visualize my own death so clearly, I decided to accept it, and act as if I had died. I did what my heirs would have done with my belongings, I filled four dumpsters and sold the house, but I kept the money. I went to Harvard, a great move, and then after 1.5 years, went on the road. No regrets. </p>\<p>One thing you learn after visualizing your own death, is that if people cared a bit about what you think while you're alive, you can be absolutely sure they won't care what you thought (past tense) after you're dead. So why bother caring what you think while you're alive. So much time is wasted trying to prove you're right. You're not right, neither am I. </p>\<p>On my travels I met a couple struggling in their marriage. They told me their story. It was pretty personal. Afterwards, processing the conversation, I realized one thing. How much happier they would be if they stopped caring about being right. Having a lover who wants to be with you can be a totally joyous thing, but people make it so complicated. Do yourself a favor, write off the idea of being right, and just seek pleasure and helping other people, esp the person you love, and by all means help yourself. You may have decades, but they'll pass pretty quickly, might as well have some fun?</p>\<p>Now back to Bill Clinton. Having bypass unlocked all this energy for me, and look what I've done with the new chance I got. Now imagine the power that Bill Clinton has, one of a handfull of livng ex-presidents, a rich man, with nothing but possibilities. He could really make a difference. I remember hearing him speak at Davos in 2000, he was an inspiration. Find a shared vision, he said. Indeed. A man of Clinton's power, freed of any idea that what he thinks means anything, could really make a difference, and I think he will. But give him a year to work through all the michegas, emotional and physical, before he's ready to resume his place in the world, fully.</p>\",Software

"PHPSurveyor is a set of PHP scripts that allows you to develop and publish online multi-question surveys. In addition to a large range of question types, and presentation methods, PHPSurveyor also allows for survey branching (ie: conditional questions), optional participant control through a token system, and includes the capacity to export survey results to excel or Comma Delimited Files.\\\PHPSurveyor also provides basic statistical analysis, with optional jpgraph based images.\\PHPSurveyor 0.98 Final is the culmination of 15 months of development and expansion for PHPSurveyor since the ""stable"" release of 0.97final.\\The package has undergone significant changes and enchancements, however - importantly - can still be installed over the top of an existing 0.97final installation, and upgraded without losing data.\\While this is labelled a ""stable"" release, indicating that the recent months have been dedicated to bugfixing rather than the development of new features, PHPSurveyor should continue to be considered a development in beta. Although significant testing has taken place, bugs may still exist, and patches for these will be released where possible.\\Please note also, that the translations are not complete - english and german are fully up to date (thanks to Carsten Schmitz, PHPSurveyors German Translator) however other languages will need some additional translation work.\\Before upgrading an earlier version of PHPSurveyor, always do a full backup of your PHPSurveyor database using phpMyAdmin or another tool.\\Hope you enjoy this release of PHPSurveyor. Thanks to all the assistance, words of encouragement, suggestions, bug notifications and general help provided by the PHPSurveyor community.\\\You can find this latest release here:\https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=74605 package_id=77691\\Jason Cleeland\PHPSurveyor Project Administrator",Software
