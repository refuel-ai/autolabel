Re: the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.  A few weeks ago I finished 'Scorched Earth: Stalin's Reign of Terror' by German scholar Jörg Baberowski (2016).  It goes into great detail about how citizens were murdered when they didn't wholeheartedly embrace the seizure of their small farms by the state, the collectivization of agriculture.  We're talking tens of millions of people, and not all that different from the  Khmer Rouge reign of terror you mentioned.

Almost every democrat was in favor of the bill and most republicans opposed the bill. There were three competing versions of the idea with one coming from the republicans called the Aldrich plan.
