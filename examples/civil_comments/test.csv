"Paul: Thank you for your kind words.  I do, indeed, have strong beliefs and don't hide them.  They are based on both facts and values.  I think the question of ""bias"" and ""prejudice"" comes into play when we're discussing beliefs and attitudes based on values.  One of our poster friends,  for example, often comments that being ""intolerant"" of a bias, for example, is, in itself, a bias.  This is, IMO, where the concept of ""irratonal antipathy"" is important.  If I dislike neo-Nazis because of their views on race, my antipathy is based on fact (knowledge of their views) and values (my belief that condemning others because of their race/religion is WRONG).  Were I to, instead, dislike all Germans, that, IMO, would represent a bias...an irrational antipathy...since not all Germans condemn others because of their race/religion.  I discuss the ""bias"" question in another response to you....

It's an interesting topic and I'd enjoy discussing it w/you sometime.  Give me a call.  Gary Crum",not toxic

Let’s see if I understand this; Berkowitz announces a $14M surplus then he rails against Proposition 8 because it would constrain his ability to confiscate even more money from citizens. Berkowitz and his allies on the Assembly changed the tax cap language to facilitate confiscating greater amounts of citizen’s money. Now why would a mayor who professes fidelity with the taxpayers change the law to enable him to take more money from them? Probably because he plans to take more money from them.  Berkowitz said if Proposition 8 passes “it severely constrains our ability to give out property tax relief.”  So Berkowitz wants the ability to confiscate more of the citizen’s money to provide property relief. How about taking less of that money in the first place?  Let’s hope Proposition 8 passes.,not toxic

"As the Minister of Information and Policy and Strategy advisor to the Hawaiian Kingdom I can state unequivocally and with full authority that the ""aquarium industry"" is in violation of one of the basic principles of Hawaiian culture, malama aina.

Malama aina has been a traditional socio-cultural practice of Hawaiians and ALL Polynesian peoples for many many thousands of years. Malama aina roughly translates as ""nurture and sustain what feeds and provides for us"". It means that we must act ethically, sustainably and on a subsistence basis at ALL times whenever we take food or resources from nature,

To do this we take from nature only what we need to sustain ourselves and NOTHING more and we do nothing that might effect the natural balance of all living things.

The ""aquarium industry"" violates this basic Hawaiian principle because it takes reef fish for monetary profit NOT for subsistence.

What party of the two parties tends to trample religious rights--except of course when it comes to Muslims?  (The Democrats love Muslims) It certainly isn't the Republican party.

One is that it is quite possible he did not throw the grenade that killed the American soldier; his wounds when he was found were severe, he was under a pile of rubble and he was unarmed.  The other is that if as a 15 year old he killed someone in a fight in Canada, he would be treated as a young offender and would have served far less time than he has.  At the same time, Dallaire is quite right to point out that he was controlled by a manipulative and abusive father.  It isn't realistic to think that given the environment he was in -- surrounded by Al Queada fighters -- that getting out of the situation was remotely possible.
He's never had anything like a fair trial; it is time for those who unload such vitriol at him to stop reacting emotionally and look at the facts of the case.",not toxic

Alternative fact - ""It’s 2017, and Cape Town’s dams are sitting at 11%. Experts have always told us that the bottom 10% of water should ideally not be taken out both for ecological reasons and because it needs extra purification. This effectively means the well in Cape Town has run dry and the worth of water has shot up to the top of every Capetonian’s serious concerns""

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was given impetus by a detailed tax-simplification proposal from President Reagan’s Treasury Department, and was designed to be tax-revenue neutral because Reagan stated that he would veto any bill that was not. Revenue neutrality was targeted by decreasing individual income tax rates, eliminating $30 billion annually in loopholes, while increasing corporate taxes, capital gains taxes.”",not toxic

To draw some $167 billion to jumpstart the $1 trillion, 10-year infrastructure plan, Washington would grant a giant tax break “equal to 82 percent of the equity amount.” The goal isn’t fixing bridges so much as fixing the corporate tax codes to promote privatization and unregulated construction with virtually no public input.",not toxic

From a ""reality ""TV"" star it was expected, from candidate Trump it was, first, amusing, then increasingly concerning; from the soon-to-be President, it's simply frightening.  Yes, that's my OPINION.  If you think his ever-changing tweets and denial of reality are OK, please explain why.....it might make me feel better.  Thanks, Gary

In other words, continually raising taxes can be self-defeating.

For one, the middle 20% of taxpayers are not the middle class - the ""middle class"" comprises as much as 2/3 of the population in countries like Australia.

This means you can have a country of the ultra rich 1% and 99% poor and no middle class, and the middle 20% of taxpayers are still all poor.

Two, you can cut taxes without cutting them for the rich - you lower the rate in the bottom brackets, benefiting the poor and middle class, and raise the bracket on the rich to compensate. Done.

By 1997-98, the federal government recorded its first annual surplus in 28 years, and (as of 2007) has continued to post large surpluses every year.

The similarity to Tebow is pretty funny. I've always liked Tebow and the enthusiasm he had but knew he wasn't going to ever change into a modern NFL QB. I think the last game he played for the Eagles put the nail in the coffin for him and me too. Tebow was really playing well that day. Making all the throws and was on target. I though man all that schooling he was having was finally start to pay off. But once the defense changed a few things that was all it took. He dropped to pass and started to panic and did that spin move to his right  to start running and there was a LB to clobber him. I think that told him and everyone else right there he was done. Lynch looks the same to me. Going to take more coaching and a team to play more to his talents.,not toxic

"One thing that I don't see in any press on this subject is the impact of a big minimum wage hike on the cost of child care.  Lots of child care workers earn a lot less than $13/hour.  I think all child care workers are undervalued and should earn far more than they do, but I don't know many families who can afford to pay significantly more for child care. Infant care in a center costs around $1200 a month now.  A big wage hike would push that cost up by hundreds of dollars a month, as the biggest expense most child care centers have is wages.  I think we'll see a lot of mothers pushed out of the labor force by the jump in child care costs.  Combine the loss of an income with generally higher costs for goods and services, and this minimum wage hike will hit middle class families hard.   I have yet to see Kotek or anyone else explain how families are going to manage the increased cost of child care, and I haven't seen anyone in the press ask them to.",not toxic

He inspired a new coaching staff to dump Kase Keenum and keep him as the starter. Paxton Lynch has not come close to doing anything even close to that. When Siemian was injured and the Broncos played Lynch, he couldn't hold onto the gig and Siemian had to play even when he less than 100%. His 2nd year with a new coaching staff he was again handily beaten out by the incumbent. I think the comparisons to Goff are unwarranted. Goff had a slow start but now is firmly in control. Lynch? He might not even have his job as a second stringer firmly in his grasp. If Siemian doesn't show improvement the Broncos are in trouble because there is nothing on the bench.

You only have to look to the Lac Megentic disaster to understand why.  The railway that caused the problem, was a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary of an American corporation.  This corporate structure was designed to protect the US investors from a disaster such as the one that occurred in Lac Megentic, with the Canadian subsidiary declaring bankruptcy, and the US parent corporation taking the assets and profits back to the US for their shareholders.  In the end, Harper quietly paid $100m Canadian tax dollars to clean the tragedy up.

Two key traits of an autocrat are detachment from reality and craving mass adulation at any cost. Trump suffers from both.

His supporters ignore the moral difference and buy into the false equivalence between the radical left and right, they see BLM and Antifa as repugnant as the KKK.  

He is stating a fact that some parties on both sides were looking for a fight.  For the most part, the media is ignoring that small grain of truth.  Trump supporters position their arguments as a defense of the right to free speech and expression.

From 1988 to 2003 there was a steady increase in the rate up to 4.95%.  The increase was the direct result of dire warnings that CPP would be insolvent within 20 years if the program wasn't changed.

Your employer or the self-employed of course double that contribution for the respective period.  Which is a cost ultimately borne by the employee in foregone pay increases.

Current government policy is to increase the contributions by another full 1% within the next 8 years.  

So we have gone from a program that cost employees 3.6% to one that currently costs almost 10% increasing to 12% in the near term.",not toxic
"Yes, the House may choose to ignore the Senate when it voices opposition to a piece of legislation. In practice, sometimes it modifies the legislation and sometimes it doesn't change it at all. However, at the end of the day the Senate must approve the legislation or it cannot become law in Canada.

If the Senate refused to endorse the clear will of the House of Commons, there would be much rumbling about a ""constitutional crisis."" However it wouldn't be a crisis of the written constitution, which assigns equal power in passing law to the Senate. Instead it would be a political crisis, where elected lawmakers express outrage that their unelected peers in the Senate would dare to defy them. The magnitude of that political crisis would depend on a lot of things. In some cases it might not be too big a deal; in others it could be a game changer.

"The question of buying a house depends on the market conditions. One has to consider the difference between rent + utilities and mortgage, utilities, insurances, taxes, and maintenance.

For example, rent: $800, and mortgage: $1200, but with other expenses, total cost: $1900.

Suppose that the house price is $270K, with $55K downpayment, and the price is appreciating at 5% annually. 

Suppose stock market is paying 10%, and mortgage interest rate is 3.5%

Over a 5 year outlook:
Net Worth with Stock Market = 80,500 + 109,904 = 190,404 - (15% capital gains) = 161K
Net Worth with House = $344,596 - 189,816 (remaining mortgage liability)  - Exit Costs (3.5%)= 142K

One of the things that is different with investment calculation today, is the leverage on the mortage.

Um, no, that sentiment was neither stated nor implied in your original post.

The real estate industry has historically obtained written consent from its seller's and buyer's for the purpose of allowing the industry to share pertinent data within the industry and to consumer's, on an individual basis. There was not any consent sought or obtained that would condone the sharing of collected data on a broad scale, publicly, and to suggest to the contrary is: preposterous! Any suggestion now that seller's or buyer's are not entitled to have any contractual say in how the industry disseminates collected data amounts to: aggressive, self serving, enterprise. It is a lame attempt at rationalization to suggest that because data may be obtained, to some extent or another by going to a Government source, it should or could be seen a waiver against the contractual commitments within a real estate contract.",not toxic

"Electric vehicle subsidies don't make any sense unless EVs are inherently a superior technology which requires a critical mass of adoption to drive down the costs to the point where the vehicles can complete directly on their own merits. The fact that Ontario is the largest car manufacturing jurisdiction in North America is another factor which needs to be kept in mind, as is the fact that Ontario, Quebec and BC each have surfeit of clean electricity.

As early as 2007 mainstream manufacturers such as VW recognized that “all cars eventually will be electric”, but have been slow to act on that important insight.  The reason that all cars will eventually be electric relates to the fact that electric cars are, as a matter of thermodynamic efficiency, at least 500% more efficient than gas cars, have approximately 99% fewer moving parts in the drive train and cost only about 10% as much as a gas car to power. EV subsidies are helping this new technology to overcome legacy barriers to entry.",not toxic

The other major savings that will occur is the cost of the electric and the maintenance of steel on steel.

Why do we have 1 or 2 on ramps less then a 1/4 mile away from an off ramp??? Knocking it down will save on the never ending cost of maintaining the rail. Or leave the rail in place and end it at the stadium. Then we can use it for emergency and HOV lane with 4 or more people and motorcycles. Then use the rest of the money that was supposed to be used to go to middle street and use that to close some on ramps that occur right before off ramps. Like Punahou Ward and Vineyard.

"A few points to keep in mind:
1. The US private timber owners will never be enthused by large volumes of Canadian lumber flowing into the US when prices are depressed by lack of demand. Things have changed however. The industry in BC is no longer required to cut to protect jobs in order to keep their forest tenures.
2. The pine beetle kill in BC is precipitating a shortage of timber which will eventually cause the closure of more BC mills.
3. Given this shortage BC's forest industry is buying mills in the US. Margins are much higher there and output from these southern mills is providing over 20% of the lumber in the US market.
4. The new President of the US is not politically beholden to the US lumber lobby and will probably make a decision based on the effect import duties would have on home construction prices. It is possible, though, that he will open federal lands to logging that have heretofore been closed to that activity to increase domestic timber supply.",not toxic
