Screening History Among Women with Invasive Cervical Cancer in an Academic Medical Center: Will We Miss Cancers Following Updated Guidelines?,"Updated guidelines for the screening and management of cervical cancer in the United States recommend starting Papanicolaou (Pap) testing at age 21 and screening less frequently with less aggressive management for abnormalities. We sought to examine updated Pap test screening guidelines and how they may affect the detection of invasive cervical cancer, especially among women<30 years of age.
Patients diagnosed at Brigham and Women's Hospital with invasive cervical cancer between 2002 and 2012 were retrospectively identified. Prior screening history was obtained and patients were divided into two groups based on age<30 years or age ≥30 years. The two groups were then compared with respect to demographics, pathological findings, and time to diagnosis.
A total of 288 patients with invasive cervical carcinoma were identified. Among these patients, 109 had adequate information on prior screening history. Invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) was diagnosed in 37 (33.94%) patients, whereas 64 (58.72%) patients were diagnosed with invasive squamous cell carcinoma (ISCC). The remaining eight patients were diagnosed with other types of cancers of the cervix. A total of 13 patients were younger than 30 while 96 patients were 30 or older. The mean time from normal Pap to diagnosis of IAC was 15 months in patients younger than 30 years of age compared to 56 months in patients aged 30 and older (p < 0.001). The mean time from normal Pap to diagnosis of ISCC was 38 months in patients younger than 30 years of age and 82 months in patients aged 30 and older (p = 0.018).",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,No
Is ankle/arm pressure predictive for cardiovascular mortality in older patients living in nursing homes?,"longitudinal descriptive study.
2 large nursing homes in Turin, Italy.
418 dependent elderly (83 males, 335 females, mean age 83.7+/-8.5 y, range 55-102) living in the nursing homes.
the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) was evaluated using a Doppler Ultrasound measurement of AAI (Ankle/Arm blood pressure Index). Death causes according to ICD-9-CM were ascertained on patient's clinical records.
Diagnosis of PAD was made in 122 subjects (29.2%) with AAI<0.90. After a 3 year follow-up 203 patients (48.6%) died. The presence of PAD was not related to total mortality or to mortality for ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease or other causes. IHD mortality was significantly and independently related to low haemoglobin values, previous cerebrovascular disease, polypharmacy and poor mobility conditions.",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,No
Vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM): a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children?,"We observed an endoscopic abnormally in a group of children with histological esophagitis. We termed this finding ""vertical lines in esophageal mucosa"" (VLEM). We examined the relationship between the presence of VLEM and significant histologic changes in esophageal mucosal biopsies.
Between January 1, 1992, and August 31, 1994, the senior author (JFF) performed 255 esophageal biopsies. The procedure reports, available endoscopic photographs, and histology reports were reviewed to establish the endoscopic and histologic appearance of the esophageal mucosa. Intraepithelial cells were counted in a blind review of 42 randomly selected biopsies.
The esophageal mucosa had a normal appearance on 160 endoscopic studies (Group 1) and VLEM were the only mucosal abnormalities in 41 endoscopies (Group 2). Histology was normal in 92 of 160 biopsies (57.5%) from Group 1, and 1 of 41 biopsies (2.4%) from Group 2. Most patients in Group 2 had eosinophilic esophagitis (34 of 41, 83%, specificity 0.85, sensitivity 0.5, p>0.001) which was of moderate to severe intensity (31 of 34, 91.2%, specificity 0.88, sensitivity 0.73, p<0.001).",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Ovarian torsion in children: is oophorectomy necessary?,"Most pediatric surgeons perform oophorectomy in girls presenting with ovarian torsion in which the ovary appears necrotic. However, the adult gynecology literature suggests that many ovaries can be treated by detorsion alone.
All children with ovarian torsion on the gynecology and general surgery services between 1988 and 2002 were reviewed.
There were 36 torsions in 34 children. Seventeen underwent detorsion with or without ovarian cystectomy, and 19 had oophorectomy (mean age 10 years in both groups). Torsion was suspected preoperatively in 94% of the detorsion cases and in 47% of the oophorectomy patients. Median time from presentation to surgery was significantly lower in the detorsion than the oophorectomy group (median 14 v 27 hours; P =.04). Postoperative complications and length of stay were similar between the 2 groups. Despite the ovary being judged intraoperatively as moderately to severely ischemic in 53% of the detorsion cases, follow-up sonogram or ovarian biopsy available in 14 of the 17 cases showed normal ovary with follicular development in each case.",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Is there a favorable subset of patients with prostate cancer who develop oligometastases?,"To analyze, retrospectively, the patterns and behavior of metastatic lesions in prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy and to investigate whether patients with<or =5 lesions had an improved outcome relative to patients with>5 lesions.
The treatment and outcome of 369 eligible patients with Stage T1-T3aN0-NXM0 prostate cancer were analyzed during a minimal 10-year follow-up period. All patients were treated with curative intent to a mean dose of 65 Gy. The full history of any metastatic disease was documented for each subject, including the initial site of involvement, any progression over time, and patient survival.
The overall survival rate for the 369 patients was 75% at 5 years and 45% at 10 years. The overall survival rate of patients who never developed metastases was 90% and 81% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. However, among the 74 patients (20%) who developed metastases, the survival rate at both 5 and 10 years was significantly reduced (p<0.0001). The overall survival rate for patients who developed bone metastases was 58% and 27% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, and patients with bone metastases to the pelvis fared worse compared with those with vertebral metastases. With regard to the metastatic number, patients with<or =5 metastatic lesions had superior survival rates relative to those with>5 lesions (73% and 36% at 5 and 10 years vs. 45% and 18% at 5 and 10 years, respectively; p = 0.02). In addition, both the metastasis-free survival rate and the interval measured from the date of the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer to the development of bone metastasis were statistically superior for patients with<or =5 lesions compared with patients with>5 lesions (p = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). However, the survival rate and the interval from the date of diagnosis of bone metastasis to the time of death for patients in both groups were not significantly different, statistically (p = 0.17 and 0.27, respectively).",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Does somatostatin confer insulinostatic effects of neuromedin u in the rat pancreas?,"Neuromedin U (NmU) is a neuropeptide with anorexigenic activity. Two receptor subtypes (NmUR1 and NmUR2) confer the effects of NmU on target cells. We have recently demonstrated that NmU reduces insulin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets. Aim of our current study is to investigate the role of somatostatin at mediating the effects of NmU on insulin secretion.
Expression of NmU in the pancreas was detected by immunohistochemistry. Insulin and somatostatin secretion from in situ perfused rat pancreas and isolated pancreatic islets was measured by radioimmunoassay. The paracrine effects of somatostatin within pancreatic islets were blocked by cyclosomatostatin, a somatostatin receptor antagonist.
Receptor subtype NmUR1, but not NmUR2, was expressed in the endocrine pancreas, predominantly in the periphery. Neuromedin U reduced insulin secretion from in situ perfused rat pancreas and stimulated somatostatin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets. Neuromedin U stimulated somatostatin secretion at both physiological and supraphysiological glucose concentrations. Cyclosomatostatin increased insulin secretion and reduced NmU-induced inhibition of insulin secretion.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Are intraoperative precursor events associated with postoperative major adverse events?,"Precursor events are undesirable events that can lead to a subsequent adverse event and have been associated with postoperative mortality. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether precursor events are associated with a composite endpoint of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (death, acute renal failure, stroke, infection) in a low- to medium-risk coronary artery bypass grafting, valve, and valve plus coronary artery bypass grafting population. These events might be targets for strategies aimed at quality improvement.
The present study was a retrospective cohort design performed at the Queen Elizabeth Health Science Centre. Low- to medium-risk patients who had experienced postoperative MACE were matched 1:1 with patients who had not experienced postoperative MACE. The operative notes, for both groups, were scored by 5 surgeons to determine the frequency of 4 precursor events: bleeding, difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, repair or regrafting, and incomplete revascularization or repair. A univariate comparison of ≥1 precursor events in the matched groups was performed.
A total of 311 MACE patients (98.4%) were matched. The primary outcome occurred more frequently in the MACE group than in the non-MACE group (33% vs 24%; P = .015). The incidence of the individual events of bleeding and difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass was significantly higher in the MACE group. Those patients with a precursor event in the absence of MACE also appeared to have a greater prevalence of other important postoperative outcomes.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Do clinical variables predict pathologic radiographs in the first episode of wheezing?,"To determine if clinical variables assessed in relation to Albuterol aerosol treatments accurately identify children with pathologic radiographs during their initial episode of bronchospasm.
A prospective convenience sample of children with a first episode of wheezing. Data collected included demographics, baseline and post-treatment clinical score and physical examination, number of aerosols, requirement for supplemental oxygen, and disposition. Chest radiographs were obtained and interpreted, and patients were divided into 2 groups based on a pathologic versus nonpathologic radiograph interpretation. Chi2 testing was performed for categoric variables, and the student t test was performed for continuous variables. A discriminant analysis was used to develop a model.
Pathologic radiographs were identified in 61 patients (9%). Between groups, a significant difference was noted for pretreatment oxygen saturation only. Clinical score, respiratory rate, and presence of rales both pretreatment and posttreatment were not significantly different between groups. The discriminant analysis correctly predicted 90% of nonpathologic radiographs but only 15% of pathologic radiographs.",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,No
Treatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion: Is less more?,"Treatment of neonatal testicular torsion has two objectives: salvage of the involved testicle (which is rarely achieved) and preservation of the contralateral gonad. The second goal universally involves contralateral testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral torsion. However, there is controversy with regards to management of a synchronous contralateral hydrocele. It has been our policy not to address the contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective.
We reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our institution between the years 1999 and 2006. Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia.
Thirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis. None of the patients who presented with a hydrocele have developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5 years (range 4.3-11.2) follow-up.",maybe,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Does Molecular Genotype Provide Useful Information in the Management of Radioiodine Refractory Thyroid Cancers?,"Whether mutation status should be used to guide therapy is an important issue in many cancers. We correlated mutation profile in radioiodine-refractory (RAIR) metastatic thyroid cancers (TCs) with patient outcome and response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and discussed the results with other published data.
Outcome in 82 consecutive patients with metastatic RAIR thyroid carcinoma prospectively tested for BRAF, RAS and PI3KCA mutations was retrospectively analyzed, including 55 patients treated with multikinase inhibitors.
Papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) were the most frequent histological subtype (54.9 %), followed by poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma [PDTC] (30.5 %) and follicular thyroid carcinoma [FTC](14.6 %). A genetic mutation was identified in 23 patients (28 %) and BRAF was the most frequently mutated gene (23 %). Median progression-free survival (PFS) on first-line TKI treatment was 14.6 months (95% CI 9.9-18.4). BRAF mutation positively influenced median PFS, both in the entire TKI-treated cohort (median PFS 34.7 months versus 11.6 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.29; 95% CI 0.09-0.98; p = 0.03) and in the TKI-treated PTC cohort (n = 22) [log-rank p = 0.086; HR 2.95; 95 % CI 0.81-10.70). However, in TKI-treated patients, PDTC histologic subtype was the only independent prognostic factor for PFS identified in the multivariate analysis (HR 2.36; 95% CI 1.01-5.54; p = 0.048).",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Pap smears with glandular cell abnormalities: Are they detected by rapid prescreening?,"Rapid prescreening (RPS) is one of the quality assurance (QA) methods used in gynecologic cytology. The efficacy of RPS has been previously studied but mostly with respect to squamous lesions; in fact, there has been no study so far specifically looking at the sensitivity of RPS for detecting glandular cell abnormalities.
A total of 80,565 Papanicolaou (Pap) smears underwent RPS during a 25-month period. A sample was designated as ""review for abnormality"" (R) if any abnormal cells (at the threshold of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance/atypical glandular cells [AGC]) were thought to be present or was designated as negative (N) if none were detected. Each sample then underwent full screening (FS) and was designated as either R or N and also given a cytologic interpretation.
The final cytologic interpretation was a glandular cell abnormality (≥AGC) in 107 samples (0.13%); 39 of these (36.4%) were flagged as R on RPS. Twenty-four patients (33.8%) out of 71 who had histologic follow-up were found to harbor a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or carcinoma; 13 of those 24 Pap smears (54.2%) had been flagged as R on RPS. Notably, 11 AGC cases were picked up by RPS only and not by FS and represented false-negative cases; 2 of these showed endometrial adenocarcinoma on histologic follow-up.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Is expert breast pathology assessment necessary for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ ?,"Current guidelines include a recommendation that a pathologist with expertise in breast disease review all ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) specimens due to the presence of significant variability in pathologic reporting of DCIS. The objective of this study was to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of pathologic reporting of DCIS over the past decade and to determine the current impact of expert breast pathology assessment on the management of DCIS.
All patients with a diagnosis of DCIS referred to a single regional cancer centre between 1982 and 2000 have been reviewed. Inter-observer variability between initial and secondary reports has been evaluated using kappa statistics. For each case, the Van Nuys Prognostic Index (VNPI) using pathologic data obtained from the initial and reviewed pathology reports were compared. The impact of expert breast pathology on risk assessment and treatment was determined.
481 individuals with DCIS were referred and pathology review was performed on 350 patients (73%). Inter-observer agreement was high for the main pathologic features of DCIS. From 1996 to 2000, secondary pathology assessments lead to a change in the assessment of local recurrence risk in 100 cases (29%) and contributed to a change in treatment recommendation in 93 (43%) cases.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
It's Fournier's gangrene still dangerous?,"Fournier's gangrene is known to have an impact in the morbidity and despite antibiotics and aggressive debridement, the mortality rate remains high.
To assess the morbidity and mortality in the treatment of Fournier's gangrene in our experience.
The medical records of 14 patients with Fournier's gangrene who presented at the University Hospital Center ""Mother Teresa"" from January 1997 to December 2006 were reviewed retrospectively to analyze the outcome and identify the risk factor and prognostic indicators of mortality.
Of the 14 patients, 5 died and 9 survived. Mean age was 54 years (range from 41-61): it was 53 years in the group of survivors and 62 years in deceased group. There was a significant difference in leukocyte count between patients who survived (range 4900-17000/mm) and those died (range 20.300-31000/mm3).

"Neoadjuvant Imatinib in Locally Advanced Gastrointestinal stromal Tumours, Will Kit Mutation Analysis Be a Pathfinder?","Longer duration of neoadjuvant (NA) imatinib (IM) used for locally advanced (LA) gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) is not based on biology of the tumour reflected by kit mutation analysis.
LA or locally recurrent (LR) GIST treated with NA IM from May 2008 to March 2015 from a prospective database were included in the analysis. Archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (FFPE) were used for testing KIT exons 9, 11, 13 and 17 by PCR.
One hundred twenty-five patients with LA or LR GIST were treated with NA IM. Forty-five patients (36 %) had undergone c-kit mutation testing. Exon 11 was seen in 25 patients (55.5 %), 3 with exon 9 (6.7 %) and 2 with exon 13 (4.4 %). Twelve were wild type (26.6 %) and  3 (6.7 %) were declared uninterpretable. Response rate (RR) for the exon 11 mutants was higher than the non-exon 11 mutant group (84 vs. 40 %, p = 0.01). Disease stabilization rate (DSR) rates were also higher in the exon 11 subgroup than non-exon 11 group (92 vs. 75 %). Eighty-four per cent exon 11 and 75 % non-exon 11 mutants were surgical candidates. Patients undergoing surgery had significantly improved event free survival (EFS) (p < 0.001) compared to patients not undergoing surgery, with the same trend seen in OS (p = 0.021). Patients with a SD on response to NA IM had a lower EFS (p = 0.076) and OS compared to patients achieving CR/PR.

Can a Novel Surgical Approach to the Temporomandibular Joint Improve Access and Reduce Complications?,"This clinical study investigated whether the vascular-guided multilayer preauricular approach (VMPA) to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) could improve access and decrease complications.
This retrospective evaluation consisted of a consecutive series of patients who underwent TMJ surgeries through the VMPA from January through December 2013. Patients with a history of TMJ surgery were excluded. Clinical data, including operating times, subjective complaints of incision scars, functional conditions of the auriculotemporal nerve and facial nerve, and other complications, were recorded and analyzed. All patients in this study were followed for at least 6 months.
All patients (606 joints) had successful TMJ surgeries through the VMPA. All incisions healed favorably with an uneventful recovery. No patient developed permanent weakness of the facial nerve or other severe complications.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Has the 80-hour workweek improved surgical resident education in New England?,"To evaluate the effect of the 80-hour workweek restrictions on resident education within surgical programs in the New England area.
Web-based survey.
All Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accredited surgical residency programs in New England (n = 20).
Program directors/coordinators in each surgical residency program in New England.
First, American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE) scores and the passing rate of the ABS certifying examination were recorded for the years 2001, 2002, 2005, and 2006. Second, the changes in the curriculum of surgical education were documented as perceived by program coordinators and directors.
In all, 85% (17/20) of surgical programs in New England responded to the survey. The programs began to implement the 80-hour workweek from 2002 to 2004. An equal distribution of community (n = 8) and university programs (n = 9) was sampled. Prior to the initiation of the 80-hour workweek, residency programs emphasized weekly didactic sessions given by attending physicians (88%), mock orals (88%), and conventional journal club (76%). After the 80-hour workweek was implemented, the education curriculum most often consisted of didactic sessions by attending (100%), mock orals (88%), and simulation laboratories (75%). No difference was observed in ABSITE scores and first-time pass rates of the ABS examination before or after the introduction of the 80-hour workweek (20% response). Only 25% of programs felt that surgical education was improved after the implementation of the 80-hour workweek, whereas 31% felt education was worse.

Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death?,"Programmed cell death (PCD) is the regulated death of cells within an organism. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants.
The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Does ultrasound-scored synovitis depend on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous anti-TNF agents in patients with rheumatoid arthritis?,"The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the pharmacokinetics of s.c. anti-TNF agents on the grade of US-detected synovitis in RA patients.
Fifty RA patients were prospectively recruited from the Biologic Therapy Unit of our hospital. Inclusion criteria were being in treatment with s.c. anti-TNF agents and having had neither changes in therapy nor local corticosteroid injections in the previous 3 months. Patients underwent clinical, laboratory [28-joint DAS (DAS28) and Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI)]and US assessment at two time points, i.e. at peak plasma drug concentration and at trough plasma drug concentration. US assessments were performed blindly to the anti-TNF agent, the administration time and the clinical and laboratory data. Twenty-eight joints were investigated for the presence and grade (0-3) of B-mode synovitis and synovial power Doppler signal. Global indices for B-mode synovitis (BSI) and Doppler synovitis (DSI) were calculated for 12 joints and for wrist-hand-ankle-foot joints. B-mode US remission was defined as a BSI<1 and Doppler US remission as a DSI<1.
There were no significant differences between the clinical, laboratory and B-mode and Doppler US parameters at peak time and trough time (P = 0.132-0.986). There were no significant differences between the proportion of patients with active disease and those in remission according to DAS28, SDAI, B-mode US and Doppler US at peak time and trough time assessments (P = 0.070-1).",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Do acute changes in heart rate by isoproterenol affect aortic stiffness in patients with hypertension?,"Increased aortic stiffness is a independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension. Acute changes of the heart rate (HR) have been reported not to affect the aortic stiffness in pacing. However, it is unknown whether acute changes in HR caused by sympathomimetics can affect the aortic stiffness in patients with hypertension. We investigated the effect of acute changes in HR produced by isoproterenol on the aortic stiffness in 17 hypertensive patientss (mean age: 59 +/- 9 years).
All vasoactive drugs were discontinued at least 3 days before the study. The carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured by the foot-to-foot method. The pulse waves were recorded at the baseline and at every increase of HR by 5 to 10 bpm with a gradual increase of the dose of isoproterenol. The blood pressures and HR were measured simultaneously. For the analysis, HR, PWV, compliance (C), and compliance index (Ci) were converted as percent changes (delta) from the baseline values. Percent changes of the parameters of the aortic stiffness, i.e., deltaPWV, deltaC, and deltaCi, were grouped by every 10% increase in deltaHR.
There was no significant difference among groups in deltaPWV, deltaC and deltaCi (p>0.05 for each of the group). The regression analysis showed no significant correlation of deltaHR with deltaPWV and deltaC (r = 0.18, 0.13 respectively, p>0.05 for each). deltaCi had a poor correlation with deltaHR (r = 0.22, p<0.05). However, only 4.6% of deltaCi could be referred to deltaHR (r2 = 0.046).",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Are serum leptin levels a prognostic factor in advanced lung cancer?,"There are 71 previously untreated patients with cytological or histological evidence of primary lung cancer who were admitted to the oncology department between November 2013 and August 2014. Forty-five healthy individuals with age, sex and BMI matching the lung cancer patients, were recruited to take part in the study as a control group. Leptin levels were measured quantitatively by using a microELISA kit.
The serum leptin levels at diagnosis were significantly lower in lung cancer patients than those in control subjects (4.75±4.91 ng/ml, 9.67±8.02 ng/ml; p<0.001). We did not find any significant difference in leptin values related to clinicopathological parameters such as ECOG PS, weight loss, histological type, disease stage and TNM classification. Nevertheless, we demonstrated a significant correlation between serum leptin levels and BMI in lung cancer patients (correlation coefficient: 0.303; p>0.010).

Is lumbar drainage of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid fistula after spine surgery effective?,"Postoperative CSF fistulas were described in 16 of 198 patients (8%) who underwent spine surgery between 2009 and 2010. The choice of the therapeutic strategy was based on the clinical condition of the patients, taking into account the possibility to maintain the prone position continuously and the risk of morbidity due to prolonged bed rest. Six patients were treated conservatively (position prone for three weeks), ten patients were treated by positioning an external CSF lumbar drainage for ten days.

Is delayed gastric emptying following pancreaticoduodenectomy related to pylorus preservation?,"Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is the most frequent postoperative complication after pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD). This prospective, non-randomized study was undertaken to determine whether the incidence of DGE may be reduced by modifying the original reconstructive anatomy with a retrocolic duodenojejunostomy towards an antecolic duodenojejunostomy.
The study was comprised of 51 patients who underwent PPPD between August 1994 and November 1997. The operation was carried out as originally described but was modified by performing the duodenojejunostomy antecolically. Clinical data were recorded prospectively, with special regard to DGE.
After PPPD, the nasogastric tube could be removed at a median of 2 days (range 1-22 days) postoperatively; in two patients, the nasogastric tube was reinserted because of vomiting and nausea. A liquid diet was started at a median of 5 days (3-11 days); the patients were able to tolerate a full, regular diet at a median of 10 days (7-28 days). The overall incidence of DGE was 12% (n=6). No postoperative complications other than DGE were exhibited by 36 patients (71%). In this group, DGE was only seen in one patient (3%). In the second group, where postoperative complications other than DGE occurred (n=15), five patients (30%) exhibited DGE (P=0.002).",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Are Reviewers' Scores Influenced by Citations to Their Own Work?,"Academic medical researchers are judged by how often their publications are cited in the literature. When serving as journal reviewers, they may be more favorably disposed to manuscripts that cite their work. We investigate whether manuscripts that contain a citation to the reviewer's work receive higher evaluations than those that do not and whether peer reviewers encourage authors to cite that reviewer's work.
We analyzed all research manuscripts submitted in 2012 to Annals of Emergency Medicine to determine whether they contained citations to each reviewer's work. To determine whether citation affected reviewer scores, we obtained each reviewer's score of the manuscript's overall desirability (1=worst to 5=best) and used descriptive statistics and regression modeling to compare scores of cited and noncited reviewers. We also enumerated how often reviewers suggested that authors add citations to the reviewer's work or other work.
There were 395 manuscripts and 999 corresponding reviews with an manuscript desirability score. The 83 reviews by cited reviewers (8.3%) had a mean score of 2.8 (SD 1.4); the 916 reviews by noncited reviewers (91.7%), 2.5 (1.2; Δ=0.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0 to 0.6). The mean score in the 117 reviews of the noncited reviewers of the 57 manuscripts that had both cited and noncited reviewers was 2.9 (SD 1.2) compared with 2.9 (SD 1.1) for the 68 reviews by cited reviewers (Δ=0; 95% CI -0.3 to 0.4).

Does partial expander deflation exacerbate the adverse effects of radiotherapy in two-stage breast reconstruction?,"The optimum protocol for expander volume adjustment with respect to the timing and application of radiotherapy remains controversial.
Eighteen New Zealand rabbits were divided into three groups. Metallic port integrated anatomic breast expanders of 250 cc were implanted on the back of each animal and controlled expansion was performed. Group I underwent radiotherapy with full expanders while in Group II, expanders were partially deflated immediately prior to radiotherapy. Control group did not receive radiotherapy.The changes in blood flow at different volume adjustments were investigated in Group II by laser Doppler flowmetry. Variations in the histopathologic properties of the irradiated tissues including the skin, capsule and the pocket floor, were compared in the biopsy specimens taken from different locations in each group.
A significant increase in skin blood flow was detected in Group II with partial expander deflation. Overall, histopathologic exam revealed aggravated findings of chronic radiodermatitis (epidermal atrophy, dermal inflammation and fibrosis, neovascularisation and vascular changes as well as increased capsule thickness) especially around the lower expander pole, in Group II.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Does frozen section alter surgical management of multinodular thyroid disease?,"Frozen section (FS) evaluation during thyroid surgery is often used to guide intraoperative management. We sought to determine the utility of FS in patients undergoing thyroidectomy for multinodular thyroid disease.
From May 1994 through November 2004, 236 patients with multinodular goiter underwent thyroidectomy at our institution. Patient data were retrospectively analyzed to see if a frozen section was performed during the procedure and whether it changed the patient's outcome.
Of the 236 patients, 135 (57%) had intra-operative FS. There were no differences between patients who had FS analysis and those who did not with regard to age, gender, and the incidence of malignancy. Of the patients who had FS, 4/135 (3%) were subsequently diagnosed with thyroid cancer on permanent histology. Three of these FS were misread as benign. Therefore, the sensitivity of FS for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer was only 25%. Importantly, in none of the 135 patients did FS alter the intraoperative management.",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Is CA72-4 a useful biomarker in differential diagnosis between ovarian endometrioma and epithelial ovarian cancer?,"Surgical excision of ovarian endometriomas in patients desiring pregnancy has recently been criticized because of the risk of damage to healthy ovarian tissue and consequent reduction of ovarian reserve. A correct diagnosis in cases not scheduled for surgery is therefore mandatory in order to avoid unexpected ovarian cancer misdiagnosis. Endometriosis is often associated with high levels of CA125. This marker is therefore not useful for discriminating ovarian endometrioma from ovarian malignancy. The aim of this study was to establish if the serum marker CA72-4 could be helpful in the differential diagnosis between ovarian endometriosis and epithelial ovarian cancer.
Serums CA125 and CA72-4 were measured in 72 patients with ovarian endometriomas and 55 patients with ovarian cancer.
High CA125 concentrations were observed in patients with ovarian endometriosis and in those with ovarian cancer. A marked difference in CA72-4 values was observed between women with ovarian cancer (71.0%) and patients with endometriosis (13.8%) (P<0.0001).",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
The clinical significance of bile duct sludge: is it different from bile duct stones?,"Some patients with suspected common bile duct (CBD) stones are found to have sludge and no stones. Although sludge in the gallbladder is a precursor of gallbladder stones, the significance of bile duct sludge (BDS) is poorly defined. This study aimed to compare BDS with bile duct stones in terms of frequency, associated risk factors, and clinical outcome after endoscopic therapy.
The study enrolled 228 patients who underwent therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for suspected choledocholithiasis. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with BDS but no stones on ERCP and patients with CBD stones. The presence of risk factors for bile duct stones (age, periampullary diverticulum, ductal dilation or angulation, previous open cholecystectomy) were assessed at ERCP. Follow-up data (36 +/- 19 months) were obtained from medical records and by patient questioning.
Bile duct sludge occurred in 14% (31/228) of patients and was more common in females. After endoscopic clearance, CBD stones recurred in 17% (33/197) of the patients with CBD stones, and in 16% (5/31) of the patients with BDS (p = 0.99). Common bile duct dilation was less common in the sludge group. The other known risk factors for recurrent CBD stones (age, previous open cholecystectomy, bile duct angulation, and the presence of a peripampullary diverticulum) were not statistically different between the two groups.",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Can dose reduction to one parotid gland prevent xerostomia?,"Dryness of the mouth is one of the most distressing chronic toxicities of radiation therapy in head and neck cancers. In this study, parotid function was assessed in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with or without chemotherapy. Parotid function was assessed with the help of a questionnaire and parotid scintigraphy, especially with regards to unilateral sparing of the parotid gland.
In total, 19 patients were treated with compensator-based IMRT between February 2003 and March 2004. The dose to the clinical target volume ranged between 66 and 70 Gy in 30-35 fractions to 95% of the isodose volume. Ipsilateral high-risk neck nodes received an average dose of 60 Gy and the contralateral low-risk neck received a dose of 54-56 Gy. Eight of 19 patients also received concomitant chemotherapy.
Subjective toxicity to the parotid glands was assessed with the help of a questionnaire at 0, 3 and 6 months and objective toxicity was assessed with parotid scintigraphy at 0 and 3 months. The mean dose to the ipsilateral parotid gland ranged from 19.5 to 52.8 Gy (mean 33.14 Gy) and the mean dose to the contralateral gland was 11.1-46.6 Gy (mean 26.85 Gy). At a median follow-up of 13 months, 9/19 patients had no symptoms of dryness of the mouth (grade I), 8/19 had mild dryness of the mouth (grade II) and only 2/19 had grade III xerostomia, although the parotid gland could only be spared on one side in most of the patients.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Are women who are treated for hypothyroidism at risk for pregnancy complications?,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the outcomes that are associated with pregnancy and treated hypothyroidism.
This was a retrospective cohort study of all women who received prenatal care and were delivered at the University of California, San Francisco, between 1989 and 2001. All patients with hypothyroidism diagnosed before pregnancy or early in pregnancy were identified. Maternal, fetal, and obstetric outcomes were then collected and analyzed for women with hypothyroidism and compared with women without hypothyroidism.
Among 20,499 deliveries, there were 419 women (2.1%) who were treated for hypothyroidism during the study period. Hypothyroidism was more common among women>or =35 years old, white women, and women without Medicaid insurance. Treated hypothyroidism was not associated with any increase in maternal, fetal, or neonatal complications. In addition, hypothyroidism did not affect mode of delivery.",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Is double-balloon enteroscopy an accurate method to diagnose small-bowel disorders?,"The aim of this study was to analyze the contribution of the double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) for diagnosis of the small bowel disorders.
Forty-four patients (20 women, 24 men; mean age 53.5 years-old, range 21-89 years) with chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, diarrhea, polyposis, weight-loss, Roux-en-Y surgery, and other indications underwent DBE.
Twenty patients had occult or obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. The source of bleeding was identified in 15/20 (75%): multiple angiodysplasias in four, arterial-venous malformation beyond the ligament of Treitz in two that could be treated with injection successfully. Other diagnoses included: duodenal adenocarcinoma, jejunal tuberculosis, erosions and ulcer of the jejunum. Of 24 patients with other indications, the diagnosis could be achieved in 18 of them (75%), including: two lymphomas, plasmocytoma, Gardner's syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers' syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, Behçet's disease, jejunal submucosal lesion, lymphangiectasia due to blastomycosis and unspecific chronic jejunitis. Of three cases with Roux-en-Y reconstruction, two underwent DBE in order to perform biopsies of the excluded duodenum. Additionally, two patients underwent DBE to exclude Crohn's disease and lymphoma of the small bowel. The mean length of small bowel examination was 240 +/- 50 cm during a single approach. The diagnostic yield was 75% (33/44 cases) and therapeutic yield was 63.6%. No major complications were observed, only minor complication such as sore throat in 4/44 (9.1%).",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Is first-line single-agent mitoxantrone in the treatment of high-risk metastatic breast cancer patients as effective as combination chemotherapy?,"To determine whether patients with high-risk metastatic breast cancer draw benefit from combination chemotherapy as first-line treatment.
A total of 260 women with measurable metastatic breast cancer fulfilling high-risk criteria, previously untreated with chemotherapy for their metastatic disease, were randomized to receive either mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) or the combination of fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 50 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC) every 3 weeks. Treatment was continued until complete remission plus two cycles, or until disease progression. In the case of partial remission or stable disease, treatment was stopped after 12 cycles. Second-line treatment was vindesine, mitomycin and prednisolone. Gain from treatment was estimated using a modified Brunner's score composed of time to progression, patients' rating of the treatment benefit, alopecia, vomiting and performance status.
After recruitment from 1992 to 1997 and observation from 1997 to 1999, the final evaluation showed that single-agent treatment with mitoxantrone does not differ significantly from combination treatment with FEC in terms of response, objective remission rate, remission duration, time to response, time to best response, time to progression or overall survival. There was, however, a significant difference in gain from treatment using a modified Brunner's score favoring the single-agent treatment arm. There was no evidence that any subgroup would fare better with combination treatment.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Is laparoscopic sonography a reliable and sensitive procedure for staging colorectal cancer?,"Laparoscopic colectomy has developed rapidly with the explosion of technology. In most cases, laparoscopic resection is performed for colorectal cancer. Intraoperative staging during laparoscopic procedure is limited. Laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) represents the only real alternative to manual palpation during laparoscopic surgery.
We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of LUS in comparison with preoperative staging and laparoscopy in 33 patients with colorectal cancer. Preoperative staging included abdominal US, CT, and endoscopic US (for rectal cancer). Laparoscopy and LUS were performed in all cases. Pre- and intraoperative staging were related to definitive histology. Staging was done according to the TNM classification.
LUS obtained good results in the evaluation of hepatic metastases, with a sensitivity of 100% versus 62.5% and 75% by preoperative diagnostic means and laparoscopy, respectively. Nodal metastases were diagnosed with a sensitivity of 94% versus 18% with preoperative staging and 6% with laparoscopy, but the method had a low specificity (53%). The therapeutic program was changed thanks to laparoscopy and LUS in 11 cases (33%). In four cases (12%), the planned therapeutic approach was changed after LUS alone.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Do elderly cancer patients have different care needs compared with younger ones?,"The increasingly older population confronts oncologists with an imposing challenge: older cancer patients have specific healthcare needs both independent of and associated with the diagnosis of cancer. The aim of the present study is to examine whether elderly versus younger cancer patients have different needs with respect to attendance, treatment and information.
This is an observational and cross-sectional study. Cancer patients aged 35 to 82 years were consecutively interviewed. The group was divided into two subgroups aged ≤65 and ≥66 years old. The Needs Evaluation Questionnaire (NEQ) was used to assess patients' needs and demographic variables were collected. Data analysis was carried out by means of cross-tabulation analyses and the chi-square test.
The requests most frequently expressed by the older group concerned financial-insurance information (73.9%), the need to talk to people with the same illness (71.7%), the need to receive more comprehensible information from doctors and nurses (71.7%), and the need for a better dialogue with clinicians (69.6%). Few significant differences between the two age subgroups were found, with the exception of issues such as the need for intimacy and support.",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Does surgery or radiation therapy impact survival for patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers?,"Extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas (EPSCC) are rare tumors where therapy remains poorly defined. We sought to determine the impact of surgical extirpation and radiation therapy for outcomes of EPSCC.
The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried for patients with EPSCC which were further categorized by site and evaluated for survival by specific treatment strategy.
We identified 94,173 patients with small cell carcinoma of which 88,605 (94.1%) and 5,568 (5.9%) had pulmonary small cell carcinoma and EPSCC, respectively. EPSCC patients were subdivided by site with the following proportions: genitourinary (24.1%), gastrointestinal (22.1%), head and neck (7.1%), breast (4%), and miscellaneous (42.7%). Overall EPSSC and specifically gastrointestinal disease had significantly improved median, 5- and 10-year survival with surgery and/or radiation for all stages and sizes. For all EPSCCs multivariate analysis revealed age (>50), gender (female), stage (regional, distant), radiation, and surgery to be independent predictors of survival.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Will clinical studies elucidate the connection between the length of storage of transfused red blood cells and clinical outcomes?,"The temporal pattern of the biologic mechanism linking red blood cell (RBC) storage duration with clinical outcomes is yet unknown. This study investigates how such a temporal pattern can affect the power of randomized controlled trials (RCT) to detect a relevant clinical outcome mediated by the transfusion of stored RBCs.
This study was a computer simulation of four RCTs, each using a specific categorization of the RBC storage time. The trial's endpoint was evaluated assuming five hypothetical temporal patterns for the biologic mechanism linking RBC storage duration with clinical outcomes.
Power of RCTs to unveil a significant association between RBC storage duration and clinical outcomes was critically dependent on a complex interaction among three factors: 1) the way the RBC storage time is categorized in the trial design, 2) the temporal pattern assumed for the RBC storage lesion, and 3) the age distribution of RBCs in the inventory from which they are picked up for transfusion. For most combinations of these factors, the power of RCTs to detect a significant treatment effect was below 80%. All the four simulated RCTs had a very low power to disclose a harmful clinical effect confined to last week of the maximum 42-day shelf life of stored RBCs.",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Validation of the 2009 TNM version in a large multi-institutional cohort of patients treated for renal cell carcinoma: are further improvements needed?,"A new edition of the TNM was recently released that includes modifications for the staging system of kidney cancers. Specifically, T2 cancers were subclassified into T2a and T2b (<or =10 cm vs>10 cm), tumors with renal vein involvement or perinephric fat involvement were classified as T3a cancers, and those with adrenal involvement were classified as T4 cancers.
Our aim was to validate the recently released edition of the TNM staging system for primary tumor classification in kidney cancer.
Our multicenter retrospective study consisted of 5339 patients treated in 16 academic Italian centers.
Patients underwent either radical or partial nephrectomy.
Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models addressed cancer-specific survival (CSS) after surgery.
In the study, 1897 patients (35.5%) were classified as pT1a, 1453 (27%) as pT1b, 437 (8%) as pT2a, 153 (3%) as pT2b, 1059 (20%) as pT3a, 117 (2%) as pT3b, 26 (0.5%) as pT3c, and 197 (4%) as pT4. At a median follow-up of 42 mo, 786 (15%) had died of disease. In univariable analysis, patients with pT2b and pT3a tumors had similar CSS, as did patients with pT3c and pT4 tumors. Moreover, both pT3a and pT3b stages included patients with heterogeneous outcomes. In multivariable analysis, the novel classification of the primary tumor was a powerful independent predictor of CSS (p for trend<0.0001). However, the substratification of pT1 tumors did not retain an independent predictive role. The major limitations of the study are retrospective design, lack of central pathologic review, and the small number of patients included in some substages.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Does lunar position influence the time of delivery?,"To study the relationship between lunar position and the day of delivery; to investigate the synodic distribution of spontaneous deliveries, especially in relation to the presence of a full moon.
Retrospective analysis of 1248 spontaneous full-term deliveries in three-year period (36 lunar months), setted at Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Civil Hospital, Fano (Marche, Italy), using circular statistics techniques.
A connection between the distribution of spontaneous full-term deliveries and the lunar month was found.

Can nonproliferative breast disease and proliferative breast disease without atypia be distinguished by fine-needle aspiration cytology?,"Cytologic criteria reported to be helpful in the distinction of proliferative breast disease without atypia (PBD) from nonproliferative breast disease (NPBD) have not been rigorously tested.
Fifty-one air-dried, Diff-Quik-stained fine-needle aspirates (FNA) of palpable breast lesions with biopsy-proven diagnoses of NPBD (34 cases) or PBD (17 cases) were reviewed. The smears were evaluated for the cellularity, size, and architectural arrangement of the epithelial groups; the presence of single epithelial cells and myoepithelial cells; and nuclear characteristics.
The only cytologic feature found to be significantly different between PBD and NPBD was a swirling pattern of epithelial cells. A swirling pattern was noted in 13 of 17 PBD cases (76%) and 12 of 34 NPBD cases (35%) (P = 0.008).",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes

Do African American women require fewer calories to maintain weight?,"The high prevalence of obesity in African American (AA) women may result, in part, from a lower resting metabolic rate (RMR) than non-AA women. If true, AA women should require fewer calories than non-AA women to maintain weight. Our objective was to determine in the setting of a controlled feeding study, if AA women required fewer calories than non-AA women to maintain weight.
This analysis includes 206 women (73% AA), aged 22-75 years, who participated in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial-a multicenter, randomized, controlled, feeding study comparing the effects of 3 dietary patterns on blood pressure in individuals with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension. After a 3-week run-in, participants were randomized to 1 of 3 dietary patterns for 8 weeks. Calorie intake was adjusted during feeding to maintain stable weight. The primary outcome of this analysis was average daily calorie (kcal) intake during feeding.
AA women had higher baseline weight and body mass index than non-AA women (78.4 vs 72.4 kg, P<.01; 29.0 vs 27.6 kg/m(2), P<.05, respectively). During intervention feeding, mean (SD) kcal was 2168 (293) in AA women and 2073 (284) in non-AA women. Mean intake was 94.7 kcal higher in AA women than in non-AA women (P<.05).

Are acceptance rates of a national preventive home visit programme for older people socially imbalanced?,"Preventive home visits are offered to community dwelling older people in Denmark aimed at maintaining their functional ability for as long as possible, but only two thirds of older people accept the offer from the municipalities. The purpose of this study is to investigate 1) whether socioeconomic status was associated with acceptance of preventive home visits among older people and 2) whether municipality invitational procedures for the preventive home visits modified the association.
The study population included 1,023 community dwelling 80-year-old individuals from the Danish intervention study on preventive home visits. Information on preventive home visit acceptance rates was obtained from questionnaires. Socioeconomic status was measured by financial assets obtained from national registry data, and invitational procedures were identified through the municipalities. Logistic regression analyses were used, adjusted by gender.
Older persons with high financial assets accepted preventive home visits more frequently than persons with low assets (adjusted OR = 1.5 (CI95%: 1.1-2.0)). However, the association was attenuated when adjusted by the invitational procedures. The odds ratio for accepting preventive home visits was larger among persons with low financial assets invited by a letter with a proposed date than among persons with high financial assets invited by other procedures, though these estimates had wide confidence intervals.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Do resident's leadership skills relate to ratings of technical skill?,"This study sought to compare general surgery research residents' survey information regarding self-efficacy ratings to their observed performance during a simulated small bowel repair. Their observed performance ratings were based on their leadership skills in directing their assistant.
Participants were given 15 min to perform a bowel repair using bovine intestines with standardized injuries. Operative assistants were assigned to help assist with the repair. Before the procedure, participants were asked to rate their expected skills decay, task difficulty, and confidence in addressing the small bowel injury. Interactions were coded to identify the number of instructions given by the participants to the assistant during the repair. Statistical analyses assessed the relationship between the number of directional instructions and participants' perceptions self-efficacy measures. Directional instructions were defined as any dialog by the participant who guided the assistant to perform an action.
Thirty-six residents (58.3% female) participated in the study. Participants who rated lower levels of decay in their intraoperative decision-making and small bowel repair skills were noted to use their assistant more by giving more instructions. Similarly, a higher number of instructions correlated with lower perceived difficulty in selecting the correct suture, suture pattern, and completing the entire surgical task.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Is the cell death in mesial temporal sclerosis apoptotic?,"Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is characterized by neuronal loss in the hippocampus. Studies on experimental models and patients with intractable epilepsy suggest that apoptosis may be involved in neuronal death induced by recurrent seizures.
We searched evidence for apoptotic cell death in temporal lobes resected from drug-resistant epilepsy patients with MTS by using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and digoxigenin-11-dUTP (TUNEL) method and immunohistochemistry for Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-cleaved actin fragment, fractin. The temporal lobe specimens were obtained from 15 patients (six women and nine men; mean age, 29 +/- 8 years).
Unlike that in normal adult brain, we observed Bcl-2 immunoreactivity in some of the remaining neurons dispersed throughout the hippocampus proper as well as in most of the reactive astroglia. Bax immunopositivity was increased in almost all neurons. Fractin immunostaining, an indicator of caspase activity, was detected in approximately 10% of these neurons. Despite increased Bax expression and activation of caspases, we could not find evidence for DNA fragmentation by TUNEL staining. We also could not detect typical apoptotic changes in nuclear morphology by Hoechst-33258 or hematoxylin counterstaining.",maybe,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Are environmental factors important in primary systemic vasculitis?,"To investigate the association between primary systemic vasculitis (PSV) and environmental risk factors.
Seventy-five PSV cases and 273 controls (220 nonvasculitis, 19 secondary vasculitis, and 34 asthma controls) were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Factors investigated were social class, occupational and residential history, smoking, pets, allergies, vaccinations, medications, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and farm exposure in the year before symptom onset (index year). The Standard Occupational Classification 2000 and job-exposure matrices were used to assess occupational silica, solvent, and metal exposure. Stepwise multiple logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) adjusted for potential confounders. Total PSV, subgroups (47 Wegener's granulomatosis [WG], 12 microscopic polyangiitis, 16 Churg-Strauss syndrome [CSS]), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive cases were compared with control groups.
Farming in the index year was significantly associated with PSV (OR 2.3 [95% CI 1.2-4.6]), with WG (2.7 [1.2-5.8]), with MPA (6.3 [1.9-21.6]), and with perinuclear ANCA (pANCA) (4.3 [1.5-12.7]).

Does government assistance improve utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals?,"To examine whether government-funded, low-income vision care programs improve use of eye care services by low-income individuals in Canada.
Cross-sectional survey.
27,375 white respondents to the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Healthy Aging 2008/2009.
Government-funded, low-income vision care programs were reviewed. The amount of assistance provided was compared with professional fee schedules for general/routine eye examinations and market prices for eyeglasses. The utilization of eye care providers was derived from the CCHS.
To receive low-income vision care assistance, individuals must be in receipt of social assistance. Criteria for receiving social assistance are stringent. The Canadian Financial Capability Survey revealed that 7.9% of Canadians aged 45 to 64 years and 5.5% aged ≥65 years received social assistance in 2009. The CCHS found in 2008/2009 that 12.5% of citizens aged 45 to 64 years and 13.2% of those aged ≥65 years had difficulty paying for basic expenses such as food. In 5 provinces, low-income vision care assistance fully covers a general/routine eye examination. In the remainder, the assistance provided is insufficient for a general/routine eye examination. The assistance for eyeglasses is inadequate in 5 provinces, requiring out-of-pocket copayments. Among middle-aged whites who self-reported not having glaucoma, cataracts, diabetes, or vision problems not corrected by lenses, utilization of eye care providers was 28.1% among those with financial difficulty versus 41.9% among those without (p<0.05), giving a prevalence ratio 0.68 (95% CI 0.57-0.80) adjusted for age, sex and education.",maybe,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
"Body perception: do parents, their children, and their children's physicians perceive body image differently?","To compare children's, parents' and physicians' perceptions of children's body size.
We administered a structured questionnaire of body size perception using a descriptive Likert scale keyed to body image figures to children ages 12 to 18 years. The same scale was given to parents of children ages 5 to 18 years. The sample consisted of 91 children and their parents being seen in the Pediatric Gastroenterology Clinic for concerns unrelated to overweight. Weight and height of the children were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. The children's BMI percentiles were categorized as underweight (<15th), normal (15th-85th), overweight (85th-95th), and obese (95th and above). The attending physician independently completed the body image and description scale and indicated the figure that most accurately represented the patient without reference to BMI standards. Accuracy of the patients', parents', and doctors' estimates were statistically compared.
The sample population consisted of 6.4% underweight, 70.5% normal weight, 7.7% overweight, and 15.4% obese. Forty-four percent of parents underestimated children's body size using word descriptions and 47% underestimated using figures. Forty percent of the children underestimated their own body size using descriptions and 43% underestimated using figures. The physicians in this study had a higher percentage of correct estimates; however, they underestimated 33% of the patients using both word descriptions and figures.

Data were collected as part of a cross-sectional survey of postpartum health outcomes, service use, and costs of care in the first 4 weeks after postpartum hospital discharge. Recruitment of 250 women was conducted from each of 5 hospitals in Ontario, Canada (n = 1,250). Women who had given vaginal birth to a single live infant, and who were being discharged at the same time as their infant, assuming care of their infant, competent to give consent, and able to communicate in one of the study languages were eligible. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire in hospital; 890 (71.2%) took part in a structured telephone interview 4 weeks after hospital discharge.
Approximately 17 percent of participants were of low socioeconomic status. Breastfeeding and signs of infant illness were the most frequently identified concerns by women, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Signs of infant illness and infant care/behavior were the main unmet learning needs. Although few differences in identified concerns were evident, women of low socioeconomic status were significantly more likely to report unmet learning needs related to 9 of 10 topics compared with women of higher socioeconomic status. For most topics, significantly more women of both groups identified learning needs 4 weeks after discharge compared with the number who identified corresponding concerns while in hospital.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Are high flow nasal cannulae noisier than bubble CPAP for preterm infants?,"Noise exposure in the neonatal intensive care unit is believed to be a risk factor for hearing loss in preterm neonates. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices exceed recommended noise levels. High flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) are an increasingly popular alternative to CPAP for treating preterm infants, but there are no in vivo studies assessing noise production by HFNC.
To study whether HFNC are noisier than bubble CPAP (BCPAP) for preterm infants.
An observational study of preterm infants receiving HFNC or BCPAP. Noise levels within the external auditory meatus (EAM) were measured using a microphone probe tube connected to a calibrated digital dosimeter. Noise was measured across a range of frequencies and reported as decibels A-weighted (dBA).
A total of 21 HFNC and 13 BCPAP noise measurements were performed in 21 infants. HFNC gas flows were 2-5 L/min, and BCPAP gas flows were 6-10 L/min with set pressures of 5-7 cm of water. There was no evidence of a difference in average noise levels measured at the EAM: mean difference (95% CI) of -1.6 (-4.0 to 0.9) dBA for HFNC compared to BCPAP. At low frequency (500 Hz), HFNC was mean (95% CI) 3.0 (0.3 to 5.7) dBA quieter than BCPAP. Noise increased with increasing BCPAP gas flow (p=0.007), but not with increasing set pressure. There was a trend to noise increasing with increasing HFNC gas flows.",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Pitfalls in urinary stone identification using CT attenuation values: are we getting the same information on different scanner models?,"Evaluate the capability of different Computed Tomography scanners to determine urinary stone compositions based on CT attenuation values and to evaluate potential differences between each model.
241 human urinary stones were obtained and their biochemical composition determined. Four different CT scanners (Siemens, Philips, GEMS and Toshiba) were evaluated. Mean CT-attenuation values and the standard deviation were recorded separately and compared with a t-paired test.
For all tested CT scanners, when the classification of the various types of stones was arranged according to the mean CT-attenuation values and to the confidence interval, large overlappings between stone types were highlighted. The t-paired test showed that most stone types could not be identified. Some types of stones presented mean CT attenuation values significantly different from one CT scanner to another. At 80kV, the mean CT attenuation values obtained with the Toshiba Aquilion were significantly different from those obtained with the Siemens Sensation. On the other hand, mean values obtained with the Philips Brilliance were all significantly equal to those obtained with the Siemens Sensation and with the Toshiba Aquilion. At 120kV mean CT attenuation values of uric acid, cystine and struvite stones obtained with the Philips model are significantly different from those obtained with the Siemens and the Toshiba but equal to those obtained with the GE 64.",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,No
Secondhand smoke risk in infants discharged from an NICU: potential for significant health disparities?,"Secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) threatens fragile infants discharged from a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Smoking practices were examined in families with a high respiratory risk infant (born at very low birth weight; ventilated>12 hr) in a Houston, Texas, NICU. Socioeconomic status, race, and mental health status were hypothesized to be related to SHSe and household smoking bans.
Data were collected as part of The Baby's Breath Project, a hospital-based SHSe intervention trial targeting parents with a high-risk infant in the NICU who reported a smoker in the household (N = 99). Measures of sociodemographics, smoking, home and car smoking bans, and depression were collected.
Overall, 26% of all families with a high-risk infant in the NICU reported a household smoker. Almost half of the families with a smoker reported an annual income of less than $25,000. 46.2% of families reported having a total smoking ban in place in both their homes and cars. Only 27.8% families earning less than $25,000 reported having a total smoking ban in place relative to almost 60% of families earning more (p<.01). African American and Caucasian families were less likely to have a smoking ban compared with Hispanics (p<.05).

Pancreas retransplantation:  a second chance for diabetic patients?,"If pancreas transplantation is a validated alternative for type 1 diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease, the management of patients who have lost their primary graft is poorly defined. This study aims at evaluating pancreas retransplantation outcome.
Between 1976 and 2008, 569 pancreas transplantations were performed in Lyon and Geneva, including 37 second transplantations. Second graft survival was compared with primary graft survival of the same patients and the whole population. Predictive factors of second graft survival were sought. Patient survival and impact on kidney graft function and survival were evaluated.
Second pancreas survival of the 17 patients transplanted from 1995 was close to primary graft survival of the whole population (71% vs. 79% at 1 year and 59% vs. 69% at 5 years; P=0.5075) and significantly better than their first pancreas survival (71% vs. 29% at 1 year and 59% vs. 7% at 5 years; P=0.0008) regardless of the cause of first pancreas loss. The same results were observed with all 37 retransplantations. Survival of second simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantations was better than survival of second pancreas after kidney. Patient survival was excellent (89% at 5 years). Pancreas retransplantation had no impact on kidney graft function and survival (100% at 5 years).",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Is there a relationship between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation?,"Ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) may require adjunctive methods of substrate modification. Both ablation-targeting complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) recorded during AF and fractionated electrograms recorded during sinus rhythm (sinus rhythm fractionation [SRF]) have been described. However, the relationship of CFAEs with SRF is unclear.
Twenty patients (age 62 ± 9 years, 13 males) with persistent AF and 9 control subjects without organic heart disease or AF (age 36 ± 6 years, 4 males) underwent detailed CFAE and SRF left atrial electroanatomic maps. The overlap in left atrial regions with CFAEs and SRF was compared in the AF population, and the distribution of SRF was compared among patients with AF and normal controls. Propagation maps were analyzed to identify the activation patterns associated with SR fractionation.
SRF (338 ± 150 points) and CFAE (418 ± 135 points) regions comprised 29% ± 14% and 25% ± 15% of the left atrial surface area, respectively. There was no significant correlation between SRF and CFAE maps (r = .2; P = NS). On comparing patients with AF and controls, no significant difference was found in the distribution of SRF between groups (P = .74).

Do Web-based and clinic samples of gay men living with HIV differ on self-reported physical and psychological symptoms?,"Although the Internet is commonly used to recruit samples in studies of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related risk behaviors, it has not been used to measure patient-reported well-being. As the burden of long-term chronic HIV infection rises, the Internet may offer enormous potential for recruitment to research and interventions.
This study aimed to compare two samples of gay men living with HIV, one recruited via the Web and the other recruited in outpatient settings, in terms of self-reported physical and psychological symptom burden.
The Internet sample was recruited from a UK-wide Web-based survey of gay men with diagnosed HIV. Of these, 154 respondents identified themselves as resident in London and were included in this analysis. The HIV clinic sample was recruited from five HIV outpatient clinics. Of these participants, 400 gay men recruited in London clinics were included in this analysis.
The Web-based sample was younger than the clinic sample (37.3 years, SD 7.0 vs 40.9 years, SD 8.3), more likely to be in paid employment (72.8%, 99/136 vs 60.1%, 227/378), less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (58.4%, 90/154 vs 68.0%, 266/391), and had worse mean psychological symptom burden compared to the clinic sample (mean scores: 1.61, SD 1.09 vs 1.36, SD 0.96) but similar physical symptom burden (mean scores: 0.78, SD 0.65 vs 0.70, SD 0.74). In multivariable logistic regression, for the physical symptom burden model, adjusted for age, ethnicity, employment status, and ART use, the recruitment setting (ie, Web-based vs clinic) was not significantly associated with high physical symptom score. The only variable that remained significantly associated with high physical symptom score was employment status, with those in employment being less likely to report being in the upper (worst) physical symptom tertile versus the other two tertiles (adjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28-0.62, P<.001). For the psychological symptom burden model, those recruited via the Web were significantly more likely to report being in the upper (worst) tertile (adjusted OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.41-3.44, P=.001). In addition, those in employment were less likely to report being in the upper (worst) psychological symptom tertile compared to those not in employment (adjusted OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.21-0.49, P<.001).",maybe,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
"Laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections in patients with Crohn's disease: are abscesses, phlegmons, or recurrent disease contraindications?","Because of the inflammatory nature of Crohn's disease, ileocolic resections are often difficult to perform, especially if an abscess, phlegmon, or recurrent disease at a previous ileocolic anastomosis is present. Our goal was to determine whether the above factors are contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection.
Between 1992 and 1996, 46 laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections were attempted. Fourteen patients had an abscess or phlegmon treated with bowel rest before operation (group I), 10 patients had recurrent Crohn's disease at the previous ileocolic anastomosis (group II), and 22 patients had no previous operation and no phlegmon or abscess associated with their disease (group III). These groups were compared with each other and with 70 consecutive open ileocolic resections for Crohn's disease during the same time period (group IV).
Operative blood loss and time were greater in group IV than in groups I, II, and III (245 versus 151, 131, and 195 ml, respectively, and 202 versus 152, 144, and 139 minutes, respectively). Conversion to open procedure occurred in 5 patients (group I, 1 [7%]; group II, 2 [20%]; group III, 2 [9%]). Morbidity was highest in group IV (21% versus 0%, 10%, and 10%, respectively).

Antral follicle assessment as a tool for predicting outcome in IVF--is it a better predictor than age and FSH?,"The purpose of this study is to determine if baseline antral follicle assessment may serve as additional information in predicting in vitro fertilization outcome.
Prospective, descriptive preliminary study of in vitro fertilization outcome. From July 1998 to July 1999, 224 patients underwent antral follicle assessment (follicle 2-6 mm in diameter) on baseline of the planned, stimulated in vitro fertilization cycle. The outcomes were analyzed with respect to antral follicle assessment (<or = 6 or>6), basal cycle day 3 follicle stimulated hormone (<or = 10 or>10 IU/L) and maternal age (<or = 35 or>35 years).
The clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle>6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle<or = 6 (51% vs. 19%, respectively). Controlling for patient age, and basal follicle stimulated hormone, the pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with antral follicle>6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle<or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly increased with advancing maternal age, elevated basal follicle stimulated hormone levels, and baseline antral follicle<or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly higher in the group with antral follicle<or = 6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle>or = 6 (33% vs. 1%, respectively).",maybe,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Is there any relation between cervical cord plaques and discopathy in patients with multiple sclerosis?,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common chronic autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between the site of the cervical discopathy and cervical spinal cord plaque in MS patients.
This retrospective study included all patients with a definite diagnosis of MS who were treated at an outpatient clinic between September 2004 and September 2011. All patients underwent cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for primary investigation of the disease. Cervical MRI scans were evaluated for detection of any evidence of cervical discopathy and cervical MS plaques. Any correlation between the site of the MS lesions and discopathy was recorded.
From 536 patients who were involved in the study, 214 patients had both cervical discopathy and cervical cord plaques. In this group 148 (69.1% of patients) had cervical plaque at the same site of cervical discopathy. The number of patients with cervical cord plaque and discopathy at same site was significantly higher than those with plaque and discopathy at different sites (P<0.05).",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Is there an intrauterine influence on obesity?,"It has been suggested that increasing obesity levels in young women lead to intrauterine environments that, in turn, stimulate increased obesity among their offspring, generating an intergenerational acceleration of obesity levels. If this mechanism is important, the association of maternal body mass index (BMI) with offspring BMI should be stronger than the association of paternal with offspring BMI.
To compare the relative strengths of association of maternal and paternal BMI with offspring BMI at age 7.5, taking into account the possible effect of non-paternity.
We compared strength of association for maternal-offspring and paternal-offspring BMI for 4654 complete parent-offspring trios in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), using unstandardised and standardised regression analysis. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence of non-paternity on these associations.
The strength of association between parental BMI and offspring BMI at age 7.5 was similar for both parents. Taking into account correlations between maternal and paternal BMI, performing standardised rather than unstandardised regression and carrying out a sensitivity analysis for non-paternity emphasised the robustness of the general similarity of the associations. The associations between high parental BMI (top decile) and offspring BMI are also similar for both parents.",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Orthostatic myoclonus: an underrecognized cause of unsteadiness?,"Recently, orthostatic myoclonus (OM) has been suggested as a cause of gait impairment and unsteadiness in neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of orthostatic myoclonus, its clinical characteristics and the underlying associated neurological disorders.
A retrospective analysis of clinical data and electromyogram surface recordings from subjects with unexplained unsteadiness/gait impairment was performed. Diagnosis of OM was made when a pattern of non-rhythmic bursts was observed (duration range 20-100 ms; bursts per second ≤16).
Among 93 subjects studied, OM was the most frequent disorder (n = 16; 17.2%), followed by orthostatic tremor (13.9%) and low frequency tremors during orthostatism (12.9%). All patients with OM complained about unsteadiness during orthostatism and/or during gait. Leg jerking was only observed by visual inspection during orthostatism in four subjects and two also presented falls. Eleven out of 16 patients (68.7%) with OM had an associated neurodegenerative disease, such as multiple system atrophy (n = 3) Parkinson's disease (n = 2), Alzheimer's disease (n = 2), mild cognitive impairment (n = 2) and normal pressure hydrocephalus (n = 2).

Vaccine protection in the elderly: are Austrian seniors adequately protected by vaccinations?,"The aim of the study was to evaluate, if elderly persons are sufficiently protected against infectious diseases by vaccination.
300 elderly (>60 years) and 300 young (<35 years) persons from five Austrian cities were recruited according to the criteria of a field study. Antibody concentrations against tetanus, diphtheria, tickborne encephalitis and influenza were assessed by ELISA or by haemagglutination inhibition test. Disease and vaccination histories were recorded.
The results of the study demonstrate that protection against infectious diseases was frequently insufficient in the elderly. This was partly due to the fact that old persons were not vaccinated according to recommended strategies. However, low antibody concentration and a short duration of protective humoral immunity were also observed in many elderly persons in spite of regular vaccination. This was not only the case in frail, but also in healthy elderlies.",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Do follow-up recommendations for abnormal Papanicolaou smears influence patient adherence?,"To compare adherence to follow-up recommendations for colposcopy or repeated Papanicolaou (Pap) smears for women with previously abnormal Pap smear results.
Retrospective cohort study.
Three northern California family planning clinics.
All women with abnormal Pap smear results referred for initial colposcopy and a random sample of those referred for repeated Pap smear. Medical records were located and reviewed for 90 of 107 women referred for colposcopy and 153 of 225 women referred for repeated Pap smears.
Routine clinic protocols for follow-up--telephone call, letter, or certified letter--were applied without regard to the type of abnormality seen on a Pap smear or recommended examination.
Documented adherence to follow-up within 8 months of an abnormal result. Attempts to contact the patients for follow-up, adherence to follow-up recommendations, and patient characteristics were abstracted from medical records. The probability of adherence to follow-up vs the number of follow-up attempts was modeled with survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine multivariate relationships related to adherence.
The rate of overall adherence to follow-up recommendations was 56.0% (136/243). Adherence to a second colposcopy was not significantly different from that to a repeated Pap smear (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46). The use of as many as 3 patient reminders substantially improved adherence to follow-up. Women without insurance and women attending 1 of the 3 clinics were less likely to adhere to any follow-up recommendation (hazard ratio for no insurance, 0.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.93], and for clinic, 0.35 [95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.73]).",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes

101 patients who developed 152 episodes of bacteriologically confirmed VAP.
Of the 152 VAP episodes 66 were diagnosed during off-hours. Neither more bronchoscopy complications nor more inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatments for patients were observed between day and off-hour shifts. Indeed, the overall time from brochoalveolar lavage to antibiotic administration was shorter for off-hours than day-shifts due to shorter specimen collection-to-antibiotic prescription times, but antibiotic prescription-to-administration times were the same.",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,No
Is the h-index predictive of greater NIH funding success among academic radiologists?,"Despite rapid adoption of the Hirsch index (h-index) as a measure of academic success, the correlations between the h-index and other metrics of productivity remain poorly understood. The aims of this study were to determine whether h-indices were associated with greater National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding success among academic radiologists.
Using the Scopus database, h-indices were calculated for a random sample of academic radiologists with the rank of professor. Using the NIH tool Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools Expenditures and Reports, we determined the number, classification, and total years of NIH grant funding as principal investigator for each radiologist. Differences in h-index, sorted by funding status, were determined using Wilcoxon's tests. Associations between h-index and funding status were determined using logistic regression. Significant correlations between h-index and grant metrics were determined using Spearman's ρ.
Among 210 professors of radiology, 48 (23%) secured at least one NIH grant. The mean h-index was significantly higher among individuals who secured at least one NIH grant (19.1) compared to those who did not (10.4) (P<.0001). Professors with h-indices<10 compared to those with h-indices>10 were significantly less likely to receive NIH funding (odds ratio, 0.07; P = .0321). However, h-indices>10 were not significantly predictive of greater funding.

Prostate-specific antigen and free prostate-specific antigen in the early detection of prostate cancer: do combination tests improve detection?,"The combined use of free and total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in early detection of prostate cancer has been controversial. This article systematically evaluates the discriminating capacity of a large number of combination tests.
Free and total PSA were analyzed in stored serum samples taken prior to diagnosis in 429 cases and 1,640 controls from the Physicians' Health Study. We used a classification algorithm called logic regression to search for clinically useful tests combining total and percent free PSA and receiver operating characteristic analysis and compared these tests with those based on total and complexed PSA. Data were divided into training and test subsets. For robustness, we considered 35 test-train splits of the original data and computed receiver operating characteristic curves for each test data set.
The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve across test data sets was 0.74 for total PSA and 0.76 for the combination tests. Combination tests with higher sensitivity and specificity than PSA>4.0 ng/mL were identified 29 out of 35 times. All these tests extended the PSA reflex range to below 4.0 ng/mL.

Detailed analysis of sputum and systemic inflammation in asthma phenotypes: are paucigranulocytic asthmatics really non-inflammatory?,"The technique of induced sputum has allowed to subdivide asthma patients into inflammatory phenotypes according to their level of granulocyte airway infiltration. There are very few studies which looked at detailed sputum and blood cell counts in a large cohort of asthmatics divided into inflammatory phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to analyze sputum cell counts, blood leukocytes and systemic inflammatory markers in these phenotypes, and investigate how those groups compared with healthy subjects.
We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on 833 asthmatics recruited from the University Asthma Clinic of Liege and compared them with 194 healthy subjects. Asthmatics were classified into inflammatory phenotypes.
The total non-squamous cell count per gram of sputum was greater in mixed granulocytic and neutrophilic phenotypes as compared to eosinophilic, paucigranulocytic asthma and healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Sputum eosinophils (in absolute values and percentages) were increased in all asthma phenotypes including paucigranulocytic asthma, compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Eosinophilic asthma showed higher absolute sputum neutrophil and lymphocyte counts than healthy subjects (p < 0.005), while neutrophilic asthmatics had a particularly low number of sputum macrophages and epithelial cells. All asthma phenotypes showed an increased blood leukocyte count compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005), with paucigranulocytic asthmatics having also increased absolute blood eosinophils compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005).

Are failures of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction associated with steep posterior tibial slopes?,"Recently, increasing number of literature has identified the posterior tibial slope (PTS) as one of the risk factors of primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. However, few studies concerning the association between failure of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) and PTS have been published. The objective of this study was to explore the association between the failure of ACLR and PTS at a minimum of two years follow-up.
Two hundred and thirty eight eligible patients from June 2009 to October 2010 were identified from our database. A total of 20 failure cases of ACLR and 20 randomly selected controls were included in this retrospective study. The demographic data and the results of manual maximum side-to-side difference with KT-1000 arthrometer at 30° of knee flexion and pivot-shift test before the ACLR and at the final follow-up were collected. The medial and lateral PTSs were measured using the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, based on Hudek's measurement. A comparison of PTS between the two groups was performed.
The overall failure rate of the present study was 8.4%. Of the 40 participants, the mean medial PTS was 4.1° ± 3.2° and the mean lateral PTS was 4.6° ± 2.6°. The medial PTS of the ACLR failure group was significantly steeper than the control group (3.5° ± 2.5° vs. 6.1° ± 2.1°, P = 0.000). Similarly, the lateral PTS of the ACLR failure group was significantly steeper than the control group (2.9° ± 2.1° vs. 5.5° ± 3.0°, P = 0.006).

Ultra high risk (UHR) for psychosis criteria: are there different levels of risk for transition to psychosis?,"The ultra high risk (UHR) for psychosis criteria have been validated in a number of studies.

The current study investigated this issue over a 6-month follow-up period. We hypothesised that the risk of transition would increase in the following order: Trait alone<APS alone<APS+Trait<BLIPS.
Data on UHR intake criteria and transition to psychosis status at 6 months were analysed for UHR patients seen at the PACE clinic, Orygen Youth Health between January 2000 and November 2008.

Standardizing care in medical oncology: are Web-based systems the answer?,"Medical oncology is embracing information technology to standardize care and improve patient outcomes, with a range of Web-based systems used internationally. The authors' aim was to determine the factors affecting the uptake and use of a Web-based protocol system for medical oncology in the Australian setting.
The authors conducted 50 interviews and observed medical oncology physicians, nurses, and pharmacists in their treatment setting at 6 hospitals in different geographic locations.
The Web-based system plays a major role in guiding oncology treatment across participating sites. However, its use varies according to hospital location, clinician roles, and experience. A range of issues impact on clinicians' attitudes toward and use of the Web-based system. Important factors are clinician-specific (eg, their need for autonomy and perceptions of lack of time) or environmental (eg, hospital policy on protocol use, endorsement of the system, and the availability of appropriate infrastructure, such as sufficient computers). The level of education received regarding the system was also found to be integral to its ongoing use.",maybe,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Storage of vaccines in the community: weak link in the cold chain?,"To assess quality of storage of vaccines in the community.
Questionnaire survey of general practices and child health clinics, and monitoring of storage temperatures of selected refrigerators.
Central Manchester and Bradford health districts.
45 general practices and five child health clinics, of which 40 (80%) responded. Eight practices were selected for refrigeration monitoring.
Adherence to Department of Health guidelines for vaccine storage, temperature range to which vaccines were exposed over two weeks.
Of the 40 respondents, only 16 were aware of the appropriate storage conditions for the vaccines; eight had minimum and maximum thermometers but only one of these was monitored daily. In six of the eight practices selected for monitoring of refrigeration temperatures the vaccines were exposed to either subzero temperatures (three fridges) or temperatures up to 16 degrees C (three).

Affect-regulated exercise intensity: does training at an intensity that feels 'good' improve physical health?,"Affect-regulated exercise to feel 'good' can be used to control exercise intensity amongst both active and sedentary individuals and should support exercise adherence. It is not known, however, whether affect-regulated exercise training can lead to physical health gains. The aim of this study was to examine if affect-regulated exercise to feel 'good' leads to improved fitness over the course of an 8-week training programme.
A repeated measures design (pretest-posttest) with independent groups (training and control).
20 sedentary females completed a submaximal graded exercise test and were then allocated to either a training group or control group. The training group completed two supervised sessions and one unsupervised session per week for 8 weeks. Exercise intensity was affect-regulated to feel 'good'. Following the 8 weeks of training, both groups completed a second submaximal graded exercise test.
Repeated measures analyses of variance indicated a significant increase in the time to reach ventilatory threshold in the training group (318 ± 23.7s) compared to control (248 ± 16.9s). Overall compliance to training was high (>92%). Participants in the training group exercised at intensities that would be classified as being in the lower range of the recommended guidelines (≈ 50% V˙O(2) max) for cardiovascular health.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Pulmonary valve replacement in adults late after repair of tetralogy of fallot: are we operating too late?,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate right ventricular (RV) volume and function after pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) and to address the issue of optimal surgical timing in these patients.
Chronic pulmonary regurgitation (PR) following repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) leads to RV dilation and an increased incidence of sudden cardiac death in adult patients.
We studied 25 consecutive adult patients who underwent PVR for significant PR late after repair of TOF. Radionuclide angiography was performed in all at a mean of 8.2 months (+/- 8 months) before PVR and repeated at a mean of 28.0 months (+/- 22.8 months) after the operation. Right ventricular (RV) end-systolic volume (RVESV), RV end-diastolic volume (RVEDV) and RV ejection fraction (RVEF) were measured.
Mean RVEDV, RVESV and RVEF remained unchanged after PVR (227.1 ml versus 214.9 ml, p = 0.74; 157.4 ml versus 155.4 ml, p = 0.94; 35.6% versus 34.7%, p = 0.78, respectively). Of the 10 patients with RVEF>or = 0.40 before PVR, 5 patients (50%) maintained a RVEF>or = 0.40 following PVR, whereas only 2 out of 15 patients (13%) with pre-operative values<0.40 reached an RVEF>or = 0.40 postoperatively (p<0.001).",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Is the Distance Worth It?,"It is unclear whether traveling long distances to high-volume centers would compensate for travel burden among patients undergoing rectal cancer resection.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether operative volume outweighs the advantages of being treated locally by comparing the outcomes of patients with rectal cancer treated at local, low-volume centers versus far, high-volume centers.
This was a population-based study.
The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with rectal cancer.
Patients with stage II or III rectal cancer who underwent surgical resection between 2006 and 2012 were included.
The outcomes of interest were margins, lymph node yield, receipt of neoadjuvant chemoradiation, adjuvant chemotherapy, readmission within 30 days, 30-day and 90-day mortality, and 5-year overall survival.
A total of 18,605 patients met inclusion criteria; 2067 patients were in the long-distance/high-volume group and 1362 in the short-distance/low-volume group. The median travel distance was 62.6 miles for the long-distance/high-volume group and 2.3 miles for the short-distance/low-volume group. Patients who were younger, white, privately insured, and stage III were more likely to have traveled to a high-volume center. When controlled for patient factors, stage, and hospital factors, patients in the short-distance/low-volume group had lower odds of a lymph node yield ≥12 (OR = 0.51) and neoadjuvant chemoradiation (OR = 0.67) and higher 30-day (OR = 3.38) and 90-day mortality (OR = 2.07) compared with those in the long-distance/high-volume group.

Do cytokine concentrations in pancreatic juice predict the presence of pancreatic diseases?,"Cytokine concentration in pancreatic juice of patients with pancreatic disease is unknown. Secretin stimulation allows endoscopic collection of pancreatic juice secreted into the duodenum. We aimed to evaluate the cytokine concentrations in pancreatic juice of patients with abdominal pain to discriminate presence from absence of pancreatic disease.
From January 2003-December 2004, consecutive patients with abdominal pain compatible with pancreatic origin were enrolled. Patients underwent upper endoscopy. Intravenous secretin (0.2 mug/kg) was given immediately before scope intubation. Pancreatic juice collected from the duodenum was immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen until assays were performed. Pancreatic juice levels of interleukin-8, interleukin-6, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 were measured by modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The final diagnosis was made by the primary gastroenterologist on the basis of medical history; laboratory, endoscopic, and imaging studies; and clinical follow-up. Fisher exact test and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test were used for statistical analysis.
Of 130 patients screened, 118 met the inclusion criteria. Multivariate analysis revealed that only interleukin-8 was able to discriminate between normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis (P = .011), pancreatic cancer (P = .044), and the presence of pancreatic diseases (P = .007). Individual cytokine concentrations were not significantly different in chronic pancreatitis compared with pancreatic cancer.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Does anastomotic leakage affect functional outcome after rectal resection for cancer?,"Anastomotic leakage is the most threatening early complication in sphincter-preserving rectal cancer surgery. While the oncological consequences have been well examined, only few data exist about the functional outcome.
We investigated continence function in 150 patients after curative sphincter-preserving rectal cancer surgery. Functional results were compared in 22 patients with a clinically relevant anastomotic leakage, confirmed radiologically or endoscopically, and 128 patients with uneventful recovery. Evaluation of continence function was based on the Cleveland Clinic Continence Score and was examined in all patients with anastomotic leakage and in 111 patients without complications 107+/-46 weeks postoperatively. Additionally, 14 patients with anastomotic leakage and 58 patients with uneventful recovery underwent anorectal manometry 26+/-15 weeks postoperatively.
The continence score in patients after anastomotic leakage did not differ significantly from that in patients without complications. Sphincter function was similar.

Does short-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors cause rebound aggravation of symptoms?,"Rebound acid hypersecretion might occur after treatment with proton pump inhibitors. This study looks for a rebound aggravation of symptoms after short-term treatment with lansoprazole.STUDY: Sixty-two patients (19 men and 43 women; mean age, 54 years; range, 32-77 years) with heartburn and regurgitation and normal upper endoscopy findings were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a crossover design. There were two 5-day treatment periods with lansoprazole 60 mg once daily or placebo in random order, separated by a 9-day washout period. Reflux, total, and antacid scores were calculated for each of the treatment periods. Higher scores during the placebo period in the group given lansoprazole first than in the group given placebo first indicated a rebound aggravation of symptoms.
The mean symptom scores during the placebo period in the groups given lansoprazole first and placebo first were as follows: reflux score, 21.5 and 17.6, respectively (not significant); total score, 11.2 and 10.3, respectively (not significant); and antacid score, 8.2 and 7.2, respectively (not significant).",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no

Can calprotectin predict relapse risk in inflammatory bowel disease?,"Assessing the clinical course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients consists of periodical clinical evaluations and laboratory tests. We aimed to assess the role of calprotectin tests in predicting clinical relapse in IBD patients.
Ninety-seven patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 65 with Crohn's disease (CD) in clinical remission were prospectively included in the study. A 10-g stool sample was collected for calprotectin assay. The cutoff level was set at 130 mg/kg of feces. Patients were followed up for 1 yr after the test or until relapse. The cumulative proportion of relapses was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Statistics for equality of survival distribution were tested using the log-rank test.
The calprotectin test was positive in 44 UC patients and 26 of them relapsed within a year, while 11 of 53 UC patients with a negative calprotectin test relapsed within the same time frame. Thirty CD patients had a positive calprotectin test and 13 of them relapsed within a year, as did 7 of the 35 with a negative test result. A significant correlation emerged between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse in UC patients (P= 0.000). In CD patients, only cases of colonic CD showed a significant correlation between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse, i.e., 6 colonic CD patients were positive for the calprotectin test and 4 relapsed (P= 0.02).",maybe,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Do risk calculators accurately predict surgical site occurrences?,"Current risk assessment models for surgical site occurrence (SSO) and surgical site infection (SSI) after open ventral hernia repair (VHR) have limited external validation. Our aim was to determine (1) whether existing models stratify patients into groups by risk and (2) which model best predicts the rate of SSO and SSI.
Patients who underwent open VHR and were followed for at least 1 mo were included. Using two data sets-a retrospective multicenter database (Ventral Hernia Outcomes Collaborative) and a single-center prospective database (Prospective)-each patient was assigned a predicted risk with each of the following models: Ventral Hernia Risk Score (VHRS), Ventral Hernia Working Group (VHWG), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wound Class, and Hernia Wound Risk Assessment Tool (HW-RAT). Patients in the Prospective database were also assigned a predicted risk from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (area under the curve [AUC]) were compared to assess the predictive accuracy of the models for SSO and SSI. Pearson's chi-square was used to determine which models were able to risk-stratify patients into groups with significantly differing rates of actual SSO and SSI.
The Ventral Hernia Outcomes Collaborative database (n = 795) had an overall SSO and SSI rate of 23% and 17%, respectively. The AUCs were low for SSO (0.56, 0.54, 0.52, and 0.60) and SSI (0.55, 0.53, 0.50, and 0.58). The VHRS (P = 0.01) and HW-RAT (P < 0.01) significantly stratified patients into tiers for SSO, whereas the VHWG (P < 0.05) and HW-RAT (P < 0.05) stratified for SSI. In the Prospective database (n = 88), 14% and 8% developed an SSO and SSI, respectively. The AUCs were low for SSO (0.63, 0.54, 0.50, 0.57, and 0.69) and modest for SSI (0.81, 0.64, 0.55, 0.62, and 0.73). The ACS-NSQIP (P < 0.01) stratified for SSO, whereas the VHRS (P < 0.01) and ACS-NSQIP (P < 0.05) stratified for SSI.

The influence of atmospheric pressure on aortic aneurysm rupture--is the diameter of the aneurysm important?,"The rate of aortic aneurysm rupture correlates with the aneurysm's diameter, and a higher rate of rupture is observed in patients with larger aneurysms. According to the literature, contradictory results concerning the relationship between atmospheric pressure and aneurysm size have been reported.AIM: In this paper, we assessed the influence of changes in atmospheric pressure on abdominal aneurysm ruptures in relationship to the aneurysm's size.
The records of 223 patients with ruptured abdominal aneurysms were evaluated. All of the patients had been admitted to the department in the period 1997-2007 from the Silesia region. The atmospheric pressures on the day of the rupture and on the days both before the rupture and between the rupture events were compared. The size of the aneurysm was also considered in the analysis.
There were no statistically significant differences in pressure between the days of rupture and the remainder of the days within an analysed period. The highest frequency of the admission of patients with a ruptured aortic aneurysm was observed during periods of winter and spring, when the highest mean values of atmospheric pressure were observed; however, this observation was not statistically confirmed. A statistically non-significant trend towards the higher rupture of large aneurysms (>7 cm) was observed in the cases where the pressure increased between the day before the rupture and the day of the rupture. This trend was particularly pronounced in patients suffering from hypertension (p = 0.1).",maybe,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Is there still a need for living-related liver transplantation in children?,"To assess and compare the value of split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT).
The concept of SLT results from the development of reduced-size transplantation. A further development of SLT, the in situ split technique, is derived from LRT, which itself marks the optimized outcome in terms of postoperative graft function and survival. The combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, thus raising the question whether living donor liver transplantation is still necessary.
Outcomes and postoperative liver function of 43 primary LRT patients were compared with those of 49 primary SLT patients (14 ex situ, 35 in situ) with known graft weight performed between April 1996 and December 2000. Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.
After a median follow-up of 35 months, actual patient survival rates were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group. Actual graft survival rates were 76% and 81%, respectively. The incidence of primary nonfunction was 12% in the SLT group and 2.3% in the LRT group. Liver function parameters (prothrombin time, factor V, bilirubin clearance) and surgical complication rates did not differ significantly. In the SLT group, mean cold ischemic time was longer than in the LRT group. Serum values of alanine aminotransferase during the first postoperative week were significantly higher in the SLT group.

CYP2D6*4 allele and breast cancer risk: is there any association?,"CYP2D6 is an important cytochrome P450 enzyme. These enzymes catalyse the oxidative biotransformation of about 25% of clinically important drugs as well as the metabolism of numerous environmental chemical carcinogens. The most frequent null allele of CYP2D6 in European populations, CYP2D6*4, has been studied here in order to elucidate whether a relationship exists between this allele and the risk of developing breast cancer in a Spanish population.
Ninety-six breast cancer Spanish patients and one hundred healthy female volunteers were genotyped for the CYP2D6*4 allele using AmpliChip CYP450 Test technology.
Homozygous CYP2D6*4 frequency was significant lower in breast cancer patients than in the control group (OR=0.22, p=0.04). The heterozygous CYP2D6*4 group also displayed lower values in patients than in controls but the difference was not significant (OR=0.698, p=0.28). Therefore, the presence of the CYP2D6*4 allele seems to decrease susceptibility to breast carcinoma in the selected population.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Can communication with terminally ill patients be taught?,"Communication with terminally ill patients is a main responsibility of physicians. However, many physicians feel insufficiently prepared for this task. Models of courses resulting in improvements of communicative skills of participants have been published mainly in the Anglo-American literature. This study describes the realization of a 2-day course model based on the experiences of the first three courses of this kind in Rhineland-Palatinate, and analyzes changes of participants' communication behavior.
After each seminary, an evaluation form concerning participants' satisfaction with the course was filled in. Furthermore, all course participants received a questionnaire at the beginning and at the end of the course, as well as 3 months afterwards. The participants were asked to assess their own sense of security in seven different communication settings on a visual analog scale, and to specify perceived changes in their communication behavior 3 months after the course.
The first three courses were attended by 31 participants. Course evaluation revealed high satisfaction scores with methods as well as with clarity and relevance of the contents. Self-assessment of participants showed a growing sense of security in different communication settings.

Treatment as prevention in resource-limited settings: is it feasible to maintain HIV viral load suppression over time?,"Recently, there has been increasing interest in the role of ""treatment as prevention"" (TasP). Some of the questions regarding TasP strategies arise from the perceived difficulties in achieving and maintaining viral load (VL) suppression over time and the risk of emergence of viral resistance that could compromise future treatment options. This study was conducted to assess these questions in a resource-limited setting.
We performed a retrospective observational study of HIV-infected patients diagnosed in the pre-HAART era on follow-up at a private center from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were extracted from clinical charts. Analyses were performed to test for potential associations of selected variables with current virologic failure or use of third-line drugs.
Of 619 patients on follow-up, 82 (13.2%) were diagnosed in the pre-HAART era. At the time of our study, 79 (96.3%) patients were on HAART, with a median duration of 14 years (IQR 12-15) of therapy, and exposure to mono or dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors regimens in 47.8% of cases. Sixty-nine patients (87.3%) had undetectable VL, 37 (46.8%) never presented virologic failure, and 19 (24.1%) experienced only one failure.

Subclavian steal syndrome: can the blood pressure difference between arms predict the severity of steal?,"A side-to-side difference in systolic brachial arterial blood pressure is a common finding in subclavian artery stenosis and is frequently used as a screening tool for subclavian steal syndrome (SSS). It was the goal of this retrospective study to investigate the relationship between different vertebral artery waveform types and the side-to-side difference in systolic blood pressure in patients with sonographically proven SSS.
The records of 1860 patients from the Neuroultrasound Laboratory between January 2000 and December 2000 were screened for the diagnosis of SSS in the final ultrasound report. In all patients, bilateral brachial arterial blood pressure was measured in a sitting position prior to the ultrasound examination. Vertebral artery waveforms were classified as (1) systolic deceleration, (2) alternating flow, and (3) complete reversal at rest. Blood pressure difference as calculated by normal-side blood pressure minus lesion-side blood pressure was compared with the 3 Doppler waveform types.
SSS was found in 51 of 1860 (2.7%) ultrasonography studies of 49 patients (17 men, 32 women; mean age 65.3 +/- 10.5 years). Two patients (4%) had bilateral SSS. In 3 patients (6%), SSS was related to an innominate artery stenosis. Waveform analysis showed a completely reversed flow in 16 (31%), an alternating flow in 24 (47%), and a systolic deceleration in 11 (22%) cases.

Vitamin D supplementation and regulatory T cells in apparently healthy subjects: vitamin D treatment for autoimmune diseases?,"Epidemiological data show significant associations of vitamin D deficiency and autoimmune diseases. Vitamin D may prevent autoimmunity by stimulating naturally occurring regulatory T cells.
To elucidate whether vitamin D supplementation increases Tregs frequency (%Tregs) within circulating CD4+ T cells.
We performed an uncontrolled vitamin D supplementation trial among 50 apparently healthy subjects including supplementation of 140,000 IU at baseline and after 4 weeks (visit 1). The final follow-up visit was performed 8 weeks after the baseline examination (visit 2). Blood was drawn at each study visit to determine 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and %Tregs.

Do elderly patients benefit from surgery in addition to radiotherapy for treatment of metastatic spinal cord compression?,"Treatment of elderly cancer patients has gained importance. One question regarding the treatment of metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) is whether elderly patients benefit from surgery in addition to radiotherapy? In attempting to answer this question, we performed a matched-pair analysis comparing surgery followed by radiotherapy to radiotherapy alone.
Data from 42 elderly (age> 65 years) patients receiving surgery plus radiotherapy (S + RT) were matched to 84 patients (1:2) receiving radiotherapy alone (RT). Groups were matched for ten potential prognostic factors and compared regarding motor function, local control, and survival. Additional matched-pair analyses were performed for the subgroups of patients receiving direct decompressive surgery plus stabilization of involved vertebrae (DDSS, n = 81) and receiving laminectomy (LE, n = 45).
Improvement of motor function occurred in 21% after S + RT and 24% after RT (p = 0.39).

Does prostate morphology affect outcomes after holmium laser enucleation?,"To determine whether prostate morphology or technique used has any effect on postoperative outcomes after holmium laser enucleation of the prostate.
A retrospective review of prospectively collected data was completed for all patients undergoing a holmium laser enucleation of the prostate at our institution. Prostate morphology was classified as either ""bilobar"" or ""trilobar"" according to the cystoscopic appearance. The baseline characteristics, complications, and postoperative outcomes were collected.
A total of 304 patients with either ""bilobar"" (n = 142) or ""trilobar"" (n = 162) prostate morphology were included. The trilobar group was more likely to have longer operative times (112 vs 100 minutes, P = .04), although this difference was not significant on multivariate analysis. The postoperative outcomes were similar between the 2 groups for American Urological Association symptom score, change in American Urological Association symptom score, bother score, maximal flow rate, change in maximal flow rate, postvoid residual urine volume, and complication rate. However, the trilobar group had a significantly greater decrease in their PVR urine volume (296 vs 176 mL, P = .01), a difference that persisted on multivariate analysis. A subset analysis of the trilobar prostates revealed that performing a 2-lobe technique achieved shorter operative and enucleation times, although the difference was not significant.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Should circumcision be performed in childhood?,"To evaluate prepuce development and retractibility in a group of boys. To point out the value of circumcision and prepucial forced dilation during childhood.
Prepuce development and retractibility were evaluated in 400 boys ages between 0-16 year old.
In boys under 1 year prepuce retractibility (assessed only in children who did not undergo forced dilation previously) was type I (non retractile) in 71.5% whereas type V (completely retractile) was only 5.5%. In adolescent boys type I prepuce was observed in 1 boy only, 1.6%, whereas type V was observed in 82.3%. Furthermore, it was observed that at the time of examination for the study 106 boys who had undergone forced dilation at an earlier age had balano-prepucial adhesions again, which demonstrates that prepuce adheres again to glans penis in many boys after a forced dilation is performed. Only 11 boys were considered in need for circumcision, three of them for prepucial orifice stenosis, which prevented normal micturition, causing a prepucial sac, one case due to a constrictive ring below the prepucial edge that would have prevented ulterior retractability, two cases with repetitive balanopostitis, and five cases secondary to xerosol balanitis, accounting for 2.7% of all examined boys.",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
Autoerotic asphyxiation: secret pleasure--lethal outcome?,"Voluntary asphyxiation among children, preteens, and adolescents by hanging or other means of inducing hypoxia/anoxia to enhance sexual excitement is not uncommon and can lead to unintended death. This study addresses autoerotic asphyxiation (AEA) with the intent of increasing pediatricians' knowledge of the syndrome and awareness of its typical onset among young patients. AEA is characteristically a clandestine and elusive practice. Provided with relevant information, pediatricians can identify the syndrome, demonstrate a willingness to discuss concerns about it, ameliorate distress, and possibly prevent a tragedy.
A retrospective study was undertaken of published cases both fatal and nonfatal and included personal communications, referenced citations, clinical experience, and theoretical formulations as to causation. Characteristic AEA manifestations, prevalence, age range, methods of inducing hypoxia/anoxia, and gender weighting are presented. All sources were used as a basis for additional considerations of etiology and possibilities for intervention.
AEA can be conceptualized as a personalized, ritualized, and symbolic biopsychosocial drama. It seems to be a reenactment of intense emotional feeling-states involving an identification and sadomasochistic relationship with a female figure. Inept AEA practitioners can miscalculate the peril of the situation that they have contrived and for numerous reasons lose their gamble with death.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,No
Does spontaneous remission occur in polyarteritis nodosa?,"Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic vasculitis involving mainly medium-sized arteries and, rarely, small-sized arteries. The diagnosis is principally based on clinical exams, biopsy of an affected organ, and/or arteriography of renal or mesenteric arteries. Once diagnosed, immunosuppressive agents, such as glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide, are generally introduced as soon as possible. Whether spontaneous remission of PAN occurs is therefore largely unknown.
We describe the case of a 51-year-old woman who presented with a 4-day-history of intense pain in her left flank, hypertension, fever, microscopic hematuria, and acute renal failure. Contrast-enhanced renal ultrasound strongly suggested bilateral renal infarction. Medical history and an extensive workup allowed to exclude systemic embolism, recreational drug abuse, cardiac arrhythmias, and thrombophilia. A possible diagnosis of PAN was considered; however, within 2 weeks of admission, spontaneous remission of her clinical and biological symptoms occurred without the use of any immunosuppressive treatment. Finally, 3 months later, renal arteriography confirmed the diagnosis of PAN. The patient remains free of symptoms 1 year after initial presentation.",yes,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Are physicians meeting the needs of family caregivers of the frail elderly?,"To explore expressed needs, both formal and informal, of family caregivers of frail elderly. To evaluate roles of physicians.
Questionnaire survey of members of the Montreal Jewish community providing care for frail elderly family members.
Jewish community of Montreal.
Volunteer caregivers who were caring for a family member or friend 60 years or older, who had greatest responsibility for providing physical or emotional support to an elderly person, who saw themselves as caregivers, and who could speak English or French were studied. Of 118 volunteers, 32 were excluded because they withdrew for personal reasons or because they did not meet study criteria.
Demographic variables, functional status of the care receiver, use of home care services, and needs assessment to identify additional services.
An average of 75.4% respondents did not use formal support services. Just under half of caregivers were dissatisfied with the attention they received from the health care system, and more than one third expressed feelings of stress, depression, guilt, and isolation.",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,No
Can routinely collected ambulance data about assaults contribute to reduction in community violence?,"The 'law of spatiotemporal concentrations of events' introduced major preventative shifts in policing communities. 'Hotspots' are at the forefront of these developments yet somewhat understudied in emergency medicine. Furthermore, little is known about interagency 'data-crossover', despite some developments through the Cardiff Model. Can police-ED interagency data-sharing be used to reduce community-violence using a hotspots methodology?
12-month (2012) descriptive study and analysis of spatiotemporal clusters of police and emergency calls for service using hotspots methodology and assessing the degree of incident overlap. 3775 violent crime incidents and 775 assault incidents analysed using spatiotemporal clustering with k-means++ algorithm and Spearman's rho.
Spatiotemporal location of calls for services to the police and the ambulance service are equally highly concentrated in a small number of geographical areas, primarily within intra-agency hotspots (33% and 53%, respectively) but across agencies' hotspots as well (25% and 15%, respectively). Datasets are statistically correlated with one another at the 0.57 and 0.34 levels, with 50% overlap when adjusted for the number of hotspots. At least one in every two police hotspots does not have an ambulance hotspot overlapping with it, suggesting half of assault spatiotemporal concentrations are unknown to the police. Data further suggest that more severely injured patients, as estimated by transfer to hospital, tend to be injured in the places with the highest number of police-recorded crimes.",maybe,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,yes
Is vancomycin MIC creep a worldwide phenomenon?,"Vancomycin is the primary treatment for infections caused by methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The association of vancomycin treatment failures with increased vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is a well-recognized problem. A number of single-centre studies have identified progressive increases in glycopeptide MICs for S. aureus strains over recent years - a phenomenon known as vancomycin MIC creep. It is unknown if this is a worldwide phenomenon or if it is localized to specific centers.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the trend of vancomycin MIC for isolates of MRSA over a 3-year period in a tertiary university hospital in Portugal. MRSA isolates from samples of patients admitted from January 2007 to December 2009 were assessed. Etest method was used to determine the respective vancomycin MIC. Only one isolate per patient was included in the final analysis.
A total of 93 MRSA isolates were studied. The vancomycin MICs were 0.75, 1, 1.5 and 2 mg/L for 1 (1.1%), 19 (20.4%), 38 (40.9%), 35 (37.6%) isolates, respectively. During the 3 year period, we observed a significant fluctuation in the rate of MRSA with a vancomycin MIC > 1 mg/L (2007: 86.2%; 2008: 93.3%; 2009: 58.8%, p = 0.002). No MRSA isolate presented a MIC > 2 mg/L.",no,['yes' 'no' 'maybe'],yes,no
