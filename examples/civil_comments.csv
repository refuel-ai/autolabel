Are there any commenters who are going to call the supervisor on this obvious distortion? 

I think this email-leaking parent did exactly the right thing. If a teacher has been assigning something like this for 20 years, there's no point in ""confronting her directly"".

Save Water, Reduce Water Pollution, Improve Water Quality
Since most of the zoo's pipes, plumbing and irrigation systems also date back to the 1950s and '60s, many are outdated, leaking and well past their useful lives. The most expensive utility cost at the 55-acre zoo is water, and leaking pipes, run-off, inadequate filtration systems, and lack of water storage all contribute to wasting water and increasing costs. Replacing the sewer system and separating sewage from storm water will reduce pollution, improve water quality and save costs. Adding modern water filtration and recycling systems to the hippo and penguin pools will save over 11,000,000 gallons of water every year.

"Nick - I would be delighted if climate activists were showing up to argue for both density and housing affordability. Instead, they are mostly not showing up to the comprehensive plan hearings at all. Density, as Angus Duncan of the state climate change commission points out, is key to climate policy. If 7,00 people live within walking distance of each other, a grocery store will spring up to serve them that they can walk to, rather than drive.

"Predatory patrol towing isn't a big subject, and there is no advocacy group that is paying any attention to it, but the City of Portland has completely backed off of enforcing state law where the towing predators are operating on private property, and this is Commissioner Novick's failure. He's in charge of towing.

The City has allowed Retriever Towing to operate in open violation of ADA for years at their NW Quimby lot, and there is absolutely no provision in city ordinance that takes into account when they tow a mobility-disabled person's vehicle.  Wheelchair or no wheelchair, the person has to get themselves to the tow yard (which does not have wheelchair access).

Led by Senator Avel Gordly, the legislature enacted important new citizen protections against predatory towing effective January 1, 2008, but there is no effective way for Portlanders to learn what their rights are other than what the predatory towers themselves tell you. A description of the protections has never appeared on the City website. The version posted there has never been correct.

It is only in the past two years the the City began enforcing the signage requirements, and the City Towing Coordinator worked with the towers to pass the costs onto the citizens. $ 20 of every tow bill goes to the towers to ""compensate"" them for their signs, with no upper limit, and your $ 20 is likely to be paying for signs completely unrelated to the place your vehicle was towed from.

Portland towers are allowed to operate in open violation of state law and the City's own statutes, providing towing services to property owners for free. That is specifically prohibited by state law and City ordinance.

Senator Gordly's legislation was intended to protect people living in apartment complexes, generally low-income, minority populations, and they have no one standing up for them in City Hall. I hope you are that champion.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"An elephant in a zoo is an animal exhibition in a sterile, unnatural environment. Artificial breeding is not natural. It is a tortuous procedure as tubes for insemination are forced up the female's reproductive tract.

In contrast, larger tracts of land in sanctuary allow elephants a more natural life.  It's a holistic approach to what the elephants need.

However, the SIP at Ainsworth is the dirty little secret of the Westside. It does not meet any of the above goals. There is no diversity, access is difficult, and it is run like an exclusive private school, funded by taxpayer money. Schools overcrowded? No problem, SIP is capped at 26 students per class. Lack of budget for teachers? Not an issue, SIP has assistant teachers for every class!

Star Trek was created as a series of books and an episodic TV show, meaning that it was meant to have discreet stories told and wrapped up in a short time. Star Wars, on the other hand, was written as a series of movies with a far-reaching storyline. Star Trek is meant to be set in our own future, complete with our history and built upon our understanding of the real universe. Star Wars, however, exists ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away."" That opens SW up to potentially involve elements that would be too fantastical in a universe based on our own, no matter how futuristic.

"I'm not a big fan of either, but I've seen both, if you can count the first three Star Wars movies and a random smattering of different Star Trek episodes as having seen them. 

Of course you have an apples and oranges problem in making the comparison, because the scope of the two projects – objectives, budgets, people involved, and all things creative – were so different. Trek was conceived to sell ads on network TV, right? Wars was a Lucas/Spielburg extravaganza. Sure, Trek became a series of movies too, but that was afterthought. So it bothers me that you cite history based on the movies with Star Wars first, when Star Trek actually started almost two decades earlier than Star Wars, in 1966, as a television show. 

Production values, star power, effects, of course all go to Star Wars, and there is budget and objectives behind that. But Star Trek did start earlier, paved the way, and had a long history of different people involved, with an interesting flair for putting real human problems (racism, for example, a recurring theme in Star Trek as the different races dealt with each other) into a new perspective. And there's interesting comparisons on the big picture, too ... the great Yoda perspective and quotes, of course, and the whole power of the force, in Star Wars. But Trek embraced big picture too, like the larger collective metaphor of Seven of Nine.

"In the interest of understanding each other, I will include my comments as they were written for this article.

Hi Rachel,

In brief, I have quite a few concerns about the Commissioner's approach, namely that pursuing density without adequate protections in place to prevent displacement and invest in community stability for existing residents (in particular low-income renters, communities of color) puts us on the wrong path to being the next San Francisco where hardly anyone of modest income can afford to live. Our governments and the market have thus far failed to stem displacement in our rapidly gentrifying city, and we continue to lack the tools necessary to increase density in a way that accounts for displacement. I fear that the city of Portland will finally achieve a ""sustainable, equitable"" city, but only once the vast majority of low-income residents and communities of color are pushed outside the city limits. <continued in next comment.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"To my knowledge, the commissioner has yet to endorse Anti-Displacement PDX's 28 measures in the Comprehensive Plan. This is a crucial first step--but still just a first step--in giving the city the tools and underlying mandates necessary to better confront the problem. There's a long way to go in removing state-level pre-emptions on rent control, inclusionary zoning, and the minimum wage--all things that impact the ability of people to afford living in the city. 

I am happy to talk more about this today over the phone, but would also be happy to field questions over email if that's easier.

From Rachel: ""Could you tell me what you think of that criticism from him -- that the local environmentalists aren't mobilizing on what's an important issue that would actually have an important impact locally?""

Me:
""I don't think that there is a consensus among local environmental groups about exactly how we should be increasing density. A lot of these neighbors who are dominating the comp plan hearings are complaining about the loss of mature trees, solar access, and the general character of their neighborhoods. I think a lot of environmentalists see density development driven by a market frenzy as sometimes inherently in contradiction with some environmental values. <continued>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It's one thing if the density is resulting in more sustainable livable communities, but we are not exactly evaluating these developments and this growth on both sides of the ledger--including in particular metrics for displacement. We aren't requiring that enough social good be done. And when we try to incentivize social good instead of require it, it is comes in measures far too inadequate to do much to solve the problems we're facing. Many people in the grassroots understands that density is a radically transformational force in neighborhoods--and one that is controversial in both legitimate ways and in NIMBYist ways.

The Federal government holds the trust on all Indian lands which kinda sucks because this means Indians have less rights than the other folks living in the same state.
While it is stated that the tribes will have a say in all affairs, it is not difficult to grasp the intention of that. Literally it means Indians have no say. They are merely being humored!
As a Native American who could live on a reservation but doesn't, I say it is better to keep my heritage pure in my heart than to live where my ancestors were imprisoned under the thumb of their captures. Others are not as lucky as I am. I hope they gain their freedom soon.
If you must do something like this know that you will not have the support of the state government behind you.

Blacks- specifically men- commit a grossly disproportionate amount of crime. There. That's a fact.  According to FBI data, 4,906 black people murdered other blacks in 2010 and 2011.  White males are 40 percent of the population and committed 4,582 murders. That same year, black males were just 6.6 percent of the population but committed a staggering 5,531 murders (http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf)

Employment history and family structure are also important: so why do Leftists refuse to accept that almost 75% of blacks are raised by absentee and single parents?

As a female, I wouldn't waste my time with guns if I wanted to kill a lot of people fast. I'd use Kool-Aid and poison--like Mr. Jones, or any carrier solvent and poison in spray or pour form, or bacteria, in a pinch, sprayed on the vegetables in the supermarket. 

Back in the day, before Independence, the world was so much safer, except for in the cities. Back then, sovereignty ruled the day and if someone was overstepping their bounds, they got what they were asking for and it was okay. Today, the cities are nothing more than nested victims paying for someone else to kill and die for them, when the paid for killers are around. It's very dangerous in the cities.

"""who do you think should do the killing?""

Anyone and everyone. This is a community problem, so everyone who wants to be part of the solution should be allowed to help. As I said above: remove all protections on free ranging cats, and allow people to help. People who allow their pets to roam outside are part of the problem, because their pets are part of the problem. It would be very sad if pets were killed, but ultimately it is the owner's responsibility to make sure their pets are not out killing birds.

Years ago some Vermont acquaintances got one warning from the Ranger: Next time I see your dog running deer, I'll shoot it. Next time she saw it running deer, she did. 

Vermont does not pretend that trapping, neutering, and releasing dogs solves any problems. They are serious about threats. We just want to feel good about ourselves.

Damn these character limits.

As I've said, while I don't agree with the veil I have to agree with the woman's choice to wear one. I can see how you feel this is a way to subjugate woman and reinforce the ""property"" aspect of a male/female relationship but isn't it better to allow the woman the opportunity to remove the veil in her own time rather than forcing her not to wear one? Isn't that just a different form of forcing an external viewpoint on her?

As for ""numbers"" whatever you meant was somewhat unclear. The wearing of a veil is still rare in Canada and terms like ""mass immigration"" are meaningless. What quantity is ""mass""? What reduction in the current immigration levels would mena that it is no longer ""mass"". And frankly even with our current immigration levels, the number of women wearing a veil is very, very low.
