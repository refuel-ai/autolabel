Here are the possible levels:\npre-primary: An organization serves pre-primary if it provides early childhood education, typically for ages 3-4. In most education systems, this comprises of education levels like nursery, kindergarten, pre-k, K, etc. Essentially, all education before they step into grade 1.\nprimary: An organization serves primary if it provides education to students between ages 5 and 11. This period is typically composed of primary school and middle school. In some education systems, it is also known as grades 1 through 5.\nsecondary: An organization serves secondary if it provides education to students between ages 12 and 18. This period is typically composed of secondary and high school. In some education systems, it is also known as grades 6 through 12.\npost-secondary: Post-Secondary education comprises of post-secondary education and is an optional stage of formal learning after completing secondary and high school education. In order for an organization to be post-secondary, it needs to provide university or college level education. You need to map the education organization with the proper stages (there can be one or more than one). If it's not a formal education organization, use only 'not_education'. Valid categories are:\n{labels}",
