If the date is formatted using slashes (/) and numbers, the year should be in the range 2015-2025 or 15-25.

Return the price with any symbols related to currency if available (dollar signs, euro signs, pound signs) as well as the amount in dollars, and cents if available, and any commas or periods in between. Do not return any alphabetic characters, words, or slashes (/). The price should be an exact substring of the input. Otherwise say: \"Not available\"."

The color should be substring of the input and contain the same capitalization and spelling. The value should not contain any numbers or any non alphabetical characters. If colors are not available, return \"Not available\". Ensure that only values that are actually colors are output."
