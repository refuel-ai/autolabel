"Paul: Thank you for your kind words.  I do, indeed, have strong beliefs and don't hide them.  They are based on both facts and values.  I think the question of ""bias"" and ""prejudice"" comes into play when we're discussing beliefs and attitudes based on values.  One of our poster friends,  for example, often comments that being ""intolerant"" of a bias, for example, is, in itself, a bias.  This is, IMO, where the concept of ""irratonal antipathy"" is important.  If I dislike neo-Nazis because of their views on race, my antipathy is based on fact (knowledge of their views) and values (my belief that condemning others because of their race/religion is WRONG).  Were I to, instead, dislike all Germans, that, IMO, would represent a bias...an irrational antipathy...since not all Germans condemn others because of their race/religion.  I discuss the ""bias"" question in another response to you....

It's an interesting topic and I'd enjoy discussing it w/you sometime.  Give me a call.  Gary Crum",not toxic
Sorry you missed high school. Eisenhower sent troops to Vietnam after the French withdrew in 1954 and before that America was providing 50% of the cost of that war. WWI & WWII were won by Democrat Presidents and the last win a Republican had was 1865  but the did surrender in Korea and Vietnam and fail to win in desert Storm or these two wars.,not toxic
Let’s see if I understand this; Berkowitz announces a $14M surplus then he rails against Proposition 8 because it would constrain his ability to confiscate even more money from citizens. Berkowitz and his allies on the Assembly changed the tax cap language to facilitate confiscating greater amounts of citizen’s money. Now why would a mayor who professes fidelity with the taxpayers change the law to enable him to take more money from them? Probably because he plans to take more money from them.  Berkowitz said if Proposition 8 passes “it severely constrains our ability to give out property tax relief.”  So Berkowitz wants the ability to confiscate more of the citizen’s money to provide property relief. How about taking less of that money in the first place?  Let’s hope Proposition 8 passes.,not toxic

'Work together'? Dream on. The liberals are already busy creating the next scandal/crime to accuse President Trump of since they lose the policy debate every time. They are sniveling statist traitors and they should be ground into the dirt as they will never ever let up in their qwest to destroy this country by any means available. Of that you can be sure.,toxic

"Between racist Eastman and 'Slappy' Wilson the Wasilla delegation is an embarassment to the valley and the State. Both should resign. This is Trump's America, open racism in the Republican party and physical attacks on reporters.

What a terrific story.  In Japan they have people who are designated as 'living treasures' because they retain an expertise in sword making or ceramics.  This gentlemen should be considered a living treasure.  I am sure his canoes cost a lot of money given the work involved but it would be amazing to own one.

"Well here we go again.  Let's continue to subsidize the cost of power, costs that are out of control due to decisions made by the Liberal government.  How nice to know the government has such contempt for the citizens of Ontario that it thinks we won't understand we are being bribed with out own tax dollars - tax dollars we will have to pay back with interest - to make re-election of these corrupt fools possible.  Not enough that the deficit remains large, we will now increase that deficit to buy votes.  This stinks, just like the power plant cancellation last election.  Ontario voters, wake up and throw these bums out!!",toxic
