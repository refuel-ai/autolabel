Each labeling run with the autolabel library requires a config to be specified. The config has 5 top-level keys and several nested keys, many of which are optional.


##Task Name


The task name is just a user-provided name for the labeling task and is only used to construct display names for various labeling artifacts (i.e. column names in the output labeled csv/dataframe)


```json title="Example"
"task_name": "CompanyEntityMatch"
```


##Task Type


The task type determines how the Autolabel library should construct the request to the LLM as well as how the LLM response should be parsed and which metrics should be computed. Currently, the library supports the following task types:


- entity_matching
- classification
- named_entity_recognition
- question_answering


```json title="Example"
"task_type": "entity_matching"
```


##Dataset


The dataset config contains information about the dataset to be labeled. Specifically, there are 4 dataset config keys:


1. label_column (optional): The label column specifies the column containing the labels for each item to use for metric computation if labels are available for the dataset
2. explanation_column (optional): The explanation column specifies the column containing explanations for each item to use for chain-of-thought prompting if it is enabled in the config.
3. delimiter (optional): This key specifies the delimiter used for parsing the dataset CSV. By default, it is assumed to be a comma: ","
4. text_column (required for named entity recognition): The text column is only necessary for named entity recognition tasks and specifies the column containing the text that we intend to label and is used for determining text spans.


```json title="Example 1: Classification task"
"dataset": {
       "label_column": "label",
       "delimiter": ","
   }
```


```json title="Example 2: Chain of thought"
   "dataset": {
       "label_column": "answer",
       "explanation_column": "explanation",
       "delimiter": ","
   }
```


```json title="Example 3: Named entity recognition task"
   "dataset": {
       "label_column": "CategorizedLabels",
       "text_column": "example",
       "delimiter": ","
   }
```






##Model


The model config contains information about the LLM provider and specific model we intend to use for labeling. There are 4 model config keys:


1. provider: This key specifies the LLM provider.
2. name: The model name specifies which of the provider's models to use for generating labels.
3. params (optional): Params is a dictionary that allows the user to configure model-specific paramaters. Here is an example model params dict:
   - max_tokens: Max tokens specifies the maximum total input and output tokens for each LLM call.
   - temperature: The temperature controls how deterministic the LLM responses should be.
   - model_kwargs: The model kwargs contains the logprobs key which, when present, configures the LLM request to have the LLM return log probabilities


4. compute_confidence (optional): This boolean determines whether to compute and output confidence scores.


```json title="Example 1: Compute confidence"
"model": {
       "provider": "openai",
       "name": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
       "compute_confidence": True
   }
```


```json title="Example 2: Defining model params"
"model": {
   "provider": "openai",
   "name": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
   "params": {
       "max_tokens": 512,
       "temperature": 0.1
   }
}
```


##Embedding


The embedding config contains information about the text embedding model provider and the specific model we intend to use for computing text embeddings. There are 2 embedding config keys:


1. provider: This key specifies the text embedding model provider.
2. model: The model specifies which of the provider's text embedding models to use for generating labels. This key is optional and a default text embedding model is used if no model is specified


```json title="Example 1: Huggingface sentence transformers model"
"embedding": {
    "provider": "huggingface_pipeline",
    "model": "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
   }
```


```json title="Example 2: Google model with no model name"
"embedding": {
    "provider": "google"
    }
```


##Prompt


The prompt config contains information about how the prompt should be constructed in the request to the LLM. There are 9 prompt config keys.


1. task_guidelines: The task guidelines should contain a description of the specific labeling task, including any nuanced details about how to correctly label each item.
2. labels (required for some tasks): The labels defines the full list of labels for the model.
3. few_shot_examples (optional): The few shot examples is either a list or path to the CSV of possible seed examples to append to the prompt.
4. few_shot_selection (optional): The few shot selection is the specific strategy to use for selecting examples to use in the prompt. Currently, there are 3 example selection strategies implemented:

    - fixed
    - semantic_similarity
    - max_marginal_relevance
    
5. few_shot_num (optional): The few shot number determines how many seed examples to select and include in the prompt
6. example_template: The example template determines how each example should be formatted in the prompt. You can reference columns from the dataset by wrapping the column name with curly braces
7. output_guidelines (optional): The output guidelines specify how the output should be returned by the LLM (i.e. just return the label vs. format as CSV). It is not recommended to add output guidelines for most use cases as default guidelines are already set.
8. output_format (optional): The format of the output is either "csv" or "json", but it is not recommended to override the default selection.
9. chain_of_thought (optional): This boolean determines whether to use chain of thought in the prompt or not.


```json title="Example 1: Classification task"
"prompt": {
       "task_guidelines": "You are an expert at identifying toxic comments. You aim to act in a fair and balanced manner, where comments that provide fair criticism of something or someone are labelled 'not toxic'. Similarly, criticisms of policy and politicians are marked 'not toxic', unless the comment includes obscenities, racial slurs or sexually explicit material. Any comments that are sexually explicit, obscene, or insults a person, demographic or race are not allowed and labeled 'toxic'. \nYour job is to correctly label the provided input example into one of the following categories:\n{labels}",
       "labels": [
           "toxic",
           "not toxic"
       ],
       "example_template": "Input: {example}\nOutput: {label}"
   }
```
