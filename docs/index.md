# Getting started with Refuel Oracle

For full documentation visit [refuel.ai](https://www.refuel.ai).

## Installation
``` bash
git clone git@github.com:refuel-ai/refuel-oracle.git
cd refuel-oracle
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Environment Setup
Using refuel-oracle will usually require integrations with one or more model providers.
For this example, we will be using OpenAIâ€™s API, so we will first need to install their SDK.
``` py
pip install openai
```

We will need to set the environmental variable in the terminal
``` py
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
```

Alternatively, you could do this from within a Jupyter notebook or python instance:
``` py
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "..."
```

If using Anthropic Models, we need to install the anthropic library
``` py
pip install anthropic
```

And export the API Key in the environment variables
``` py
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."
```

## Using Oracle for classifying unlabeled data with ChatGPT

The Oracle class is initialized with a configuration file, which defines the task you would like the LLM to perform on your data (i.e. classification, entity recognition, etc.)
``` py
annotator = Oracle('examples/config_chatgpt.json')
```

Many sample configuration files can be found in the examples directory of the repository. These can act as a good starting template for other projects.

In this example, we are using ChatGPT to classify news articles into the appropriate category.
``` py
annotator.annotate(
dataset='examples/ag_news_filtered_labels_sampled.csv',
max_items=100,
)
```
