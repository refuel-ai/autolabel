# Introduction to Refuel Autolabel
**Autolabel** helps you label datasets at the speed of thought and at human-level accuracy using LLMs. 

## Features

* Support for NLP [tasks](/guide/tasks/tasks) such as classification, entity matching, question-answering and named entity-recognition. 
* Use any [LLM provider](/guide/llms/llms) such as OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace and more. 
* Support for research-proven LLM techniques such as [few-shot sampling](/guide/accuracy/example-selection) and prompting, [chain-of-thought](/guide/accuracy/chain-of-thought), etc.
* [Confidence](/guide/accuracy/confidence) scores and explanations for every single output label
* Minimize costs and experimentation time through [smart caching](/guide/reliability/llm-output-caching) and intelligent workflows

## Getting Started

You can get started with Autolabel by simpling bringing the dataset you want to label, picking your favorite LLM and writing a few lines of code. 

* [Installation and your first labeling task](guide/overview/getting-started): Steps to install Autolabel and run sentiment analysis for movie reviews using OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo`. 
* [Classification tutorial](guide/overview/tutorial-classification.md): A deeper dive into how Autolabel can be used to detect toxic comments at 95%+ accuracy. 
* [Here] () is a sample notebook that provides additional examples on using Autolabel for different NLP tasks.
