* Use any [LLM provider](/guide/llms/llms) such as OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace and more. 
* Support for research-proven LLM techniques such as [few-shot sampling](/guide/accuracy/example-selection) and prompting, [chain-of-thought](/guide/accuracy/chain-of-thought), etc.
* [Confidence](/guide/accuracy/confidence) scores and explanations for every single output label
* Minimize costs and experimentation time through [smart caching](/guide/reliability/llm-output-caching) and intelligent workflows
