**Autolabel** is a Python library to label, clean and enrich datasets with Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Features

* Autolabel data for [NLP tasks](https://docs.refuel.ai/guide/tasks/classification_task/) such as classification, question-answering and named entity-recognition, entity matching and more.
* Seamlessly use commercial and open source [LLMs](https://docs.refuel.ai/guide/llms/llms/) from providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, Google and more.
* Leverage research-proven LLM techniques to boost label quality, such as few-shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting.
* [Confidence estimation](https://docs.refuel.ai/guide/accuracy/confidence/) and explanations out of the box for every single output label
* [Caching and state management](https://docs.refuel.ai/guide/reliability/state-management/) to minimize costs and experimentation time

## Getting Started

You can get started with Autolabel by simpling bringing the dataset you want to label, picking your favorite LLM and writing a few lines of code.
